Peskin and D. Schroeder, An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory This is a very clear and comprehensive book, covering everything in this course at the right level. It will also cover everything in the “Advanced Quantum Field Theory” course, much of the “Standard Model” course, and will serve you well if you go on to do research. To a large extent, our course will follow the ﬁrst section of this book. There is a vast array of further Quantum Field Theory texts, many of them with redeeming features. Here I mention a few very diﬀerent ones.\n\n• S. Weinberg, The Quantum Theory of Fields, Vol 1 This is the ﬁrst in a three volume series by one of the masters of quantum ﬁeld theory. It takes a unique route to through the subject, focussing initially on particles rather than ﬁelds. The second volume covers material lectured in “AQFT”.\n\n• L. Ryder, Quantum Field Theory This elementary text has a nice discussion of much of the material in this course.\n\n• A. Zee, Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell This is charming book, where emphasis is placed on physical understanding and the author isn’t afraid to hide the ugly truth when necessary. It contains many gems.\n\n• M Srednicki, Quantum Field Theory A very clear and well written introduction to the subject. Both this book and Zee’s focus on the path integral approach, rather than canonical quantization that we develop in this course. There are also resources available on the web.

My primary contribution has been to borrow, steal and assimilate the best discussions and explanations I could ﬁnd from the vast literature on the subject. I inherited the course from Nick Manton, whose notes form the backbone of the lectures. I have also relied heavily on the sources listed at the beginning, most notably the book by Peskin and Schroeder.

Introduction “There are no real one-particle systems in nature, not even few-particle systems. The existence of virtual pairs and of pair ﬂuctuations shows that the days of ﬁxed particle numbers are over.” Viki Weisskopf The concept of wave-particle duality tells us that the properties of electrons and photons are fundamentally very similar. Despite obvious diﬀerences in their mass and charge, under the right circumstances both suﬀer wave-like diﬀraction and both can pack a particle-like punch. Yet the appearance of these objects in classical physics is very diﬀerent. Electrons and other matter particles are postulated to be elementary constituents of Nature. In contrast, light is a derived concept: it arises as a ripple of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. If photons and particles are truely to be placed on equal footing, how should we reconcile this diﬀerence in the quantum world? Should we view the particle as fundamental, with the electromagnetic ﬁeld arising only in some classical limit from a collection of quantum photons? Or should we instead view the ﬁeld as fundamental, with the photon appearing only when we correctly treat the ﬁeld in a manner consistent with quantum theory? And, if this latter view is correct, should we also introduce an “electron ﬁeld”, whose ripples give rise to particles with mass and charge? But why then didn’t Faraday, Maxwell and other classical physicists ﬁnd it useful to introduce the concept of matter ﬁelds, analogous to the electromagnetic ﬁeld?\n\nThe purpose of this course is to answer these questions. We shall see that the second viewpoint above is the most useful: the ﬁeld is primary and particles are derived concepts, appearing only after quantization. We will show how photons arise from the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and how massive, charged particles such as electrons arise from the quantization of matter ﬁelds. We will learn that in order to describe the fundamental laws of Nature, we must not only introduce electron ﬁelds, but also quark ﬁelds, neutrino ﬁelds, gluon ﬁelds, W and Z-boson ﬁelds, Higgs ﬁelds and a whole slew of others. There is a ﬁeld associated to each type of fundamental particle that appears in Nature. Why Quantum Field Theory?\n\nIn classical physics, the primary reason for introducing the concept of the ﬁeld is to construct laws of Nature that are local. The old laws of Coulomb and Newton involve “action at a distance”. This means that the force felt by an electron (or planet) changes\n\n– 1 – immediately if a distant proton (or star) moves. This situation is philosophically unsatisfactory. More importantly, it is also experimentally wrong. The ﬁeld theories of Maxwell and Einstein remedy the situation, with all interactions mediated in a local fashion by the ﬁeld. The requirement of locality remains a strong motivation for studying ﬁeld theories in the quantum world. However, there are further reasons for treating the quantum ﬁeld as fundamental1. Here I’ll give two answers to the question: Why quantum ﬁeld theory?\n\nAnswer 1: Because the combination of quantum mechanics and special relativity implies that particle number is not conserved. Particles are not indestructible objects, made at the beginning of the universe and here for good. They can be created and destroyed. They are, in fact, mostly ephemeral and ﬂeeting. This experimentally veriﬁed fact was ﬁrst predicted by Dirac who understood how relativity implies the necessity of anti-particles. An extreme demonstration of particle creation is shown in the picture, which comes from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven, Long Island. This machine crashes gold nuclei together, each containing 197 nucleons. The resulting explosion contains up to 10,000 particles, captured here in all their beauty by the STAR detector. Figure 1: We will review Dirac’s argument for anti-particles later in this course, together with the better understanding that we get from viewing particles in the framework of quantum ﬁeld theory. For now, we’ll quickly sketch the circumstances in which we expect the number of particles to change. Consider a particle of mass m trapped in a box of size L. Heisenberg tells us that the uncertainty in the momentum is ∆p ≥ℏ/L. In a relativistic setting, momentum and energy are on an equivalent footing, so we should also have an uncertainty in the energy of order ∆E ≥ℏc/L. However, when the uncertainty in the energy exceeds ∆E = 2mc2, then we cross the barrier to pop particle anti-particle pairs out of the vacuum. We learn that particle-anti-particle pairs are expected to be important when a particle of mass m is localized within a distance of order\n\nλ = ℏ mc 1A concise review of the underlying principles and major successes of quantum ﬁeld theory can be found in the article by Frank Wilczek, http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9803075\n\n– 2 – At distances shorter than this, there is a high probability that we will detect particleanti-particle pairs swarming around the original particle that we put in. The distance λ is called the Compton wavelength. It is always smaller than the de Broglie wavelength λdB = h/|⃗p|. If you like, the de Broglie wavelength is the distance at which the wavelike nature of particles becomes apparent; the Compton wavelength is the distance at which the concept of a single pointlike particle breaks down completely. The presence of a multitude of particles and antiparticles at short distances tells us that any attempt to write down a relativistic version of the one-particle Schr¨odinger equation (or, indeed, an equation for any ﬁxed number of particles) is doomed to failure. There is no mechanism in standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics to deal with changes in the particle number. Indeed, any attempt to naively construct a relativistic version of the one-particle Schr¨odinger equation meets with serious problems. (Negative probabilities, inﬁnite towers of negative energy states, or a breakdown in causality are the common issues that arise). In each case, this failure is telling us that once we enter the relativistic regime we need a new formalism in order to treat states with an unspeciﬁed number of particles. This formalism is quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT). Answer 2: Because all particles of the same type are the same This sound rather dumb. But it’s not! What I mean by this is that two electrons are identical in every way, regardless of where they came from and what they’ve been through. The same is true of every other fundamental particle. Let me illustrate this through a rather prosaic story. Suppose we capture a proton from a cosmic ray which we identify as coming from a supernova lying 8 billion lightyears away. We compare this proton with one freshly minted in a particle accelerator here on Earth. And the two are exactly the same! How is this possible? Why aren’t there errors in proton production? How can two objects, manufactured so far apart in space and time, be identical in all respects? One explanation that might be oﬀered is that there’s a sea of proton “stuﬀ” ﬁlling the universe and when we make a proton we somehow dip our hand into this stuﬀand from it mould a proton. Then it’s not surprising that protons produced in diﬀerent parts of the universe are identical: they’re made of the same stuﬀ. It turns out that this is roughly what happens. The “stuﬀ” is the proton ﬁeld or, if you look closely enough, the quark ﬁeld. In fact, there’s more to this tale. Being the “same” in the quantum world is not like being the “same” in the classical world: quantum particles that are the same are truely indistinguishable. Swapping two particles around leaves the state completely unchanged — apart from a possible minus sign. This minus sign determines the statistics of the particle. In quantum mechanics you have to put these statistics in by hand\n\n– 3 – and, to agree with experiment, should choose Bose statistics (no minus sign) for integer spin particles, and Fermi statistics (yes minus sign) for half-integer spin particles. In quantum ﬁeld theory, this relationship between spin and statistics is not something that you have to put in by hand. Rather, it is a consequence of the framework. What is Quantum Field Theory?\n\nHaving told you why QFT is necessary, I should really tell you what it is. The clue is in the name: it is the quantization of a classical ﬁeld, the most familiar example of which is the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In standard quantum mechanics, we’re taught to take the classical degrees of freedom and promote them to operators acting on a Hilbert space. The rules for quantizing a ﬁeld are no diﬀerent. Thus the basic degrees of freedom in quantum ﬁeld theory are operator valued functions of space and time. This means that we are dealing with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom — at least one for every point in space. This inﬁnity will come back to bite on several occasions. It will turn out that the possible interactions in quantum ﬁeld theory are governed by a few basic principles: locality, symmetry and renormalization group ﬂow (the decoupling of short distance phenomena from physics at larger scales). These ideas make QFT a very robust framework: given a set of ﬁelds there is very often an almost unique way to couple them together. What is Quantum Field Theory Good For?\n\nThe answer is: almost everything. As I have stressed above, for any relativistic system it is a necessity. But it is also a very useful tool in non-relativistic systems with many particles. Quantum ﬁeld theory has had a major impact in condensed matter, highenergy physics, cosmology, quantum gravity and pure mathematics. It is literally the language in which the laws of Nature are written. 0.1 Units and Scales Nature presents us with three fundamental dimensionful constants; the speed of light c, Planck’s constant (divided by 2π) ℏand Newton’s constant G. They have dimensions [c] = LT −1 [ℏ] = L2MT −1 [G] = L3M −1T −2 Throughout this course we will work with “natural” units, deﬁned by c = ℏ= 1 (0.1)\n\n– 4 – which allows us to express all dimensionful quantities in terms of a single scale which we choose to be mass or, equivalently, energy (since E = mc2 has become E = m). The usual choice of energy unit is eV , the electron volt or, more often GeV = 109eV or TeV = 1012eV . To convert the unit of energy back to a unit of length or time, we need to insert the relevant powers of c and ℏ. For example, the length scale λ associated to a mass m is the Compton wavelength\n\nλ = ℏ mc With this conversion factor, the electron mass me = 106eV translates to a length scale λe ∼10−12m. (The Compton wavelength is also deﬁned with an extra factor of 2π: λ = 2πℏ/mc.) Throughout this course we will refer to the dimension of a quantity, meaning the mass dimension. If X has dimensions of (mass)d we will write [X] = d. In particular, the surviving natural quantity G has dimensions [G] = −2 and deﬁnes a mass scale, G = ℏc M 2 p = 1 M 2 p (0.2) where Mp ≈1019GeV is the Planck scale. It corresponds to a length lp ≈10−33cm. The Planck scale is thought to be the smallest length scale that makes sense: beyond this quantum gravity eﬀects become important and it’s no longer clear that the concept of spacetime makes sense. The largest length scale we can talk of is the size of the cosmological horizon, roughly 1060lp.

This is a logarithmic plot, with energy increasing to the right and, correspondingly, length increasing to the left. The smallest and largest scales known are shown on the ﬁgure, together with other\n\n– 5 – relevant energy scales. The standard model of particle physics is expected to hold up to about the TeV . This is precisely the regime that is currently being probed by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. There is a general belief that the framework of quantum ﬁeld theory will continue to hold to energy scales only slightly below the Planck scale — for example, there are experimental hints that the coupling constants of electromagnetism, and the weak and strong forces unify at around 1018 GeV. For comparison, the rough masses of some elementary (and not so elementary) particles are shown in the table, Particle Mass neutrinos ∼10−2 eV electron 0.5 MeV Muon 100 MeV Pions 140 MeV Proton, Neutron 1 GeV Tau 2 GeV W,Z Bosons 80-90 GeV Higgs Boson 125 GeV\n\n– 6 – 1. Classical Field Theory In this ﬁrst section we will discuss various aspects of classical ﬁelds. We will cover only the bare minimum ground necessary before turning to the quantum theory, and will return to classical ﬁeld theory at several later stages in the course when we need to introduce new ideas. 1.1 The Dynamics of Fields A ﬁeld is a quantity deﬁned at every point of space and time (⃗x, t). While classical particle mechanics deals with a ﬁnite number of generalized coordinates qa(t), indexed by a label a, in ﬁeld theory we are interested in the dynamics of ﬁelds\n\nφa(⃗x, t) (1.1) where both a and ⃗x are considered as labels. Thus we are dealing with a system with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom — at least one for each point ⃗x in space. Notice that the concept of position has been relegated from a dynamical variable in particle mechanics to a mere label in ﬁeld theory. An Example: The Electromagnetic Field The most familiar examples of ﬁelds from classical physics are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, ⃗E(⃗x, t) and ⃗B(⃗x, t). Both of these ﬁelds are spatial 3-vectors. In a more sophisticated treatement of electromagnetism, we derive these two 3-vectors from a single 4-component ﬁeld Aµ(⃗x, t) = (φ, ⃗A) where µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 shows that this ﬁeld is a vector in spacetime. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds are given by\n\n⃗E = −∇φ −∂⃗A\n\n∂t and ⃗B = ∇× ⃗A (1.2) which ensure that two of Maxwell’s equations, ∇· ⃗B = 0 and d ⃗B/dt = −∇× ⃗E, hold immediately as identities. The Lagrangian The dynamics of the ﬁeld is governed by a Lagrangian which is a function of φ(⃗x, t), ˙φ(⃗x, t) and ∇φ(⃗x, t). In all the systems we study in this course, the Lagrangian is of the form, L(t) = Z d3x L(φa, ∂µφa) (1.3)\n\n– 7 – where the oﬃcial name for L is the Lagrangian density, although everyone simply calls it the Lagrangian. The action is, S = Z t2 t1 dt Z d3x L = Z d4x L (1.4) Recall that in particle mechanics L depends on q and ˙q, but not ¨q. In ﬁeld theory we similarly restrict to Lagrangians L depending on φ and ˙φ, and not ¨φ. In principle, there’s nothing to stop L depending on ∇φ, ∇2φ, ∇3φ, etc. However, with an eye to later Lorentz invariance, we will only consider Lagrangians depending on ∇φ and not higher derivatives. Also we will not consider Lagrangians with explicit dependence on xµ; all such dependence only comes through φ and its derivatives. We can determine the equations of motion by the principle of least action. We vary the path, keeping the end points ﬁxed and require δS = 0,\n\nδS = Z d4x \u0014 ∂L\n\n∂φa δφa + ∂L ∂(∂µφa) δ(∂µφa) \u0015\n\n= Z d4x \u0014 ∂L\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µφa)\n\n\u0013\u0015 δφa + ∂µ\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µφa) δφa\n\n\u0013 (1.5)\n\n∂φa −∂µ The last term is a total derivative and vanishes for any δφa(⃗x, t) that decays at spatial inﬁnity and obeys δφa(⃗x, t1) = δφa(⃗x, t2) = 0. Requiring δS = 0 for all such paths yields the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for the ﬁelds φa,\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µφa)\n\n\u0013 −∂L\n\n∂µ\n\n∂φa = 0 (1.6) 1.1.1 An Example: The Klein-Gordon Equation Consider the Lagrangian for a real scalar ﬁeld φ(⃗x, t), L = 1 2 ηµν ∂µφ∂νφ −1 2m2φ2 (1.7)\n\n= 1 2 ˙φ2 −1 2(∇φ)2 −1 2m2φ2 where we are using the Minkowski space metric\n\n+1\n\n!\n\nηµν = ηµν =\n\n−1 (1.8)\n\n−1\n\n−1 Comparing (1.7) to the usual expression for the Lagrangian L = T −V , we identify the kinetic energy of the ﬁeld as T = Z d3x 1 2 ˙φ2 (1.9)\n\n– 8 – and the potential energy of the ﬁeld as V = Z d3x 1 2(∇φ)2 + 1 2m2φ2 (1.10) The ﬁrst term in this expression is called the gradient energy, while the phrase “potential energy”, or just “potential”, is usually reserved for the last term. To determine the equations of motion arising from (1.7), we compute ∂L\n\n∂φ = −m2φ and ∂L ∂(∂µφ) = ∂µφ ≡( ˙φ, −∇φ) (1.11) The Euler-Lagrange equation is then ¨φ −∇2φ + m2φ = 0 (1.12) which we can write in relativistic form as\n\n∂µ∂µφ + m2φ = 0 (1.13) This is the Klein-Gordon Equation. The Laplacian in Minkowski space is sometimes denoted by □. In this notation, the Klein-Gordon equation reads □φ + m2φ = 0. An obvious generalization of the Klein-Gordon equation comes from considering the Lagrangian with arbitrary potential V (φ), 2∂µφ∂µφ −V (φ) ⇒ ∂µ∂µφ + ∂V L = 1\n\n∂φ = 0 (1.14) 1.1.2 Another Example: First Order Lagrangians We could also consider a Lagrangian that is linear in time derivatives, rather than quadratic. Take a complex scalar ﬁeld ψ whose dynamics is deﬁned by the real Lagrangian L = i 2(ψ⋆˙ψ −˙ψ⋆ψ) −∇ψ⋆· ∇ψ −mψ⋆ψ (1.15) We can determine the equations of motion by treating ψ and ψ⋆as independent objects, so that ∂L ∂ψ⋆= i 2 ˙ψ −mψ and ∂L ∂˙ψ⋆= −i 2ψ and ∂L ∂∇ψ⋆= −∇ψ (1.16) This gives us the equation of motion i∂ψ\n\n∂t = −∇2ψ + mψ (1.17) This looks very much like the Schr¨odinger equation. Except it isn’t! Or, at least, the interpretation of this equation is very diﬀerent: the ﬁeld ψ is a classical ﬁeld with none of the probability interpretation of the wavefunction. We’ll come back to this point in Section 2.8.\n\n– 9 – The initial data required on a Cauchy surface diﬀers for the two examples above. When L ∼˙φ2, both φ and ˙φ must be speciﬁed to determine the future evolution; however when L ∼ψ⋆˙ψ, only ψ and ψ⋆are needed. 1.1.3 A Final Example: Maxwell’s Equations We may derive Maxwell’s equations in the vacuum from the Lagrangian, 2 (∂µAν) (∂µAν) + 1 2(∂µAµ)2 (1.18) L = −1 Notice the funny minus signs! This is to ensure that the kinetic terms for Ai are positive using the Minkowski space metric (1.8), so L ∼1 2 ˙A2 i . The Lagrangian (1.18) has no kinetic term ˙A2 0 for A0. We will see the consequences of this in Section 6. To see that Maxwell’s equations indeed follow from (1.18), we compute\n\n∂L ∂(∂µAν) = −∂µAν + (∂ρAρ) ηµν (1.19) from which we may derive the equations of motion,\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µAν)\n\n\u0013 = −∂2Aν + ∂ν(∂ρAρ) = −∂µ(∂µAν −∂νAµ) ≡−∂µF µν (1.20)\n\n∂µ where the ﬁeld strength is deﬁned by Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ. You can check using (1.2) that this reproduces the remaining two Maxwell’s equations in a vacuum: ∇· ⃗E = 0 and ∂⃗E/∂t = ∇× ⃗B. Using the notation of the ﬁeld strength, we may rewrite the Maxwell Lagrangian (up to an integration by parts) in the compact form 4 FµνF µν (1.21) L = −1 1.1.4 Locality, Locality, Locality In each of the examples above, the Lagrangian is local. This means that there are no terms in the Lagrangian coupling φ(⃗x, t) directly to φ(⃗y, t) with ⃗x ̸= ⃗y. For example, there are no terms that look like L = Z d3xd3y φ(⃗x)φ(⃗y) (1.22) A priori, there’s no reason for this. After all, ⃗x is merely a label, and we’re quite happy to couple other labels together (for example, the term ∂3A0 ∂0A3 in the Maxwell Lagrangian couples the µ = 0 ﬁeld to the µ = 3 ﬁeld). But the closest we get for the ⃗x label is a coupling between φ(⃗x) and φ(⃗x + δ⃗x) through the gradient term (∇φ)2. This property of locality is, as far as we know, a key feature of all theories of Nature. Indeed, one of the main reasons for introducing ﬁeld theories in classical physics is to implement locality. In this course, we will only consider local Lagrangians.\n\n– 10 – 1.2 Lorentz Invariance The laws of Nature are relativistic, and one of the main motivations to develop quantum ﬁeld theory is to reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity. To this end, we want to construct ﬁeld theories in which space and time are placed on an equal footing and the theory is invariant under Lorentz transformations, xµ −→(x′)µ = Λµ νxν (1.23) where Λµ ν satisﬁes\n\nΛµ σ ηστ Λν τ = ηµν (1.24) For example, a rotation by θ about the x3-axis, and a boost by v < 1 along the x1-axis are respectively described by the Lorentz transformations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nγ −γv 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 cos θ −sin θ 0\n\n−γv γ 0 0\n\n    \n\n     and Λµ ν =\n\n    \n\n     (1.25)\n\nΛµ ν = 0 sin θ cos θ 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 with γ = 1/ √ 1 −v2. The Lorentz transformations form a Lie group under matrix multiplication. You’ll learn more about this in the “Symmetries and Particle Physics” course. The Lorentz transformations have a representation on the ﬁelds. The simplest example is the scalar ﬁeld which, under the Lorentz transformation x →Λx, transforms as\n\nφ(x) →φ′(x) = φ(Λ−1x) (1.26) The inverse Λ−1 appears in the argument because we are dealing with an active transformation in which the ﬁeld is truly shifted. To see why this means that the inverse appears, it will suﬃce to consider a non-relativistic example such as a temperature ﬁeld. Suppose we start with an initial ﬁeld φ(⃗x) which has a hotspot at, say, ⃗x = (1, 0, 0). After a rotation ⃗x →R⃗x about the z-axis, the new ﬁeld φ′(⃗x) will have the hotspot at ⃗x = (0, 1, 0). If we want to express φ′(⃗x) in terms of the old ﬁeld φ, we need to place ourselves at ⃗x = (0, 1, 0) and ask what the old ﬁeld looked like where we’ve come from at R−1(0, 1, 0) = (1, 0, 0). This R−1 is the origin of the inverse transformation. (If we were instead dealing with a passive transformation in which we relabel our choice of coordinates, we would have instead φ(x) →φ′(x) = φ(Λx)).\n\n– 11 – The deﬁnition of a Lorentz invariant theory is that if φ(x) solves the equations of motion then φ(Λ−1x) also solves the equations of motion. We can ensure that this property holds by requiring that the action is Lorentz invariant. Let’s look at our examples: Example 1: The Klein-Gordon Equation For a real scalar ﬁeld we have φ(x) →φ′(x) = φ(Λ−1x). The derivative of the scalar ﬁeld transforms as a vector, meaning (∂µφ)(x) →(Λ−1)ν µ(∂νφ)(y) where y = Λ−1x. This means that the derivative terms in the Lagrangian density transform as Lderiv(x) = ∂µφ(x)∂νφ(x)ηµν −→ (Λ−1)ρ µ(∂ρφ)(y) (Λ−1)σ ν(∂σφ)(y) ηµν\n\n= (∂ρφ)(y) (∂σφ)(y) ηρσ\n\n= Lderiv(y) (1.27) The potential terms transform in the same way, with φ2(x) →φ2(y). Putting this all together, we ﬁnd that the action is indeed invariant under Lorentz transformations, S = Z d4x L(x) −→ Z d4x L(y) = Z d4y L(y) = S (1.28) where, in the last step, we need the fact that we don’t pick up a Jacobian factor when we change integration variables from R d4x to R d4y. This follows because det Λ = 1. (At least for Lorentz transformation connected to the identity which, for now, is all we deal with). Example 2: First Order Dynamics In the ﬁrst-order Lagrangian (1.15), space and time are not on the same footing. (L is linear in time derivatives, but quadratic in spatial derivatives). The theory is not Lorentz invariant. In practice, it’s easy to see if the action is Lorentz invariant: just make sure all the Lorentz indices µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 are contracted with Lorentz invariant objects, such as the metric ηµν. Other Lorentz invariant objects you can use include the totally antisymmetric tensor ϵµνρσ and the matrices γµ that we will introduce when we come to discuss spinors in Section 4.\n\n– 12 – Example 3: Maxwell’s Equations Under a Lorentz transformation Aµ(x) →Λµ ν Aν(Λ−1x). You can check that Maxwell’s Lagrangian (1.21) is indeed invariant. Of course, historically electrodynamics was the ﬁrst Lorentz invariant theory to be discovered: it was found even before the concept of Lorentz invariance. 1.3 Symmetries The role of symmetries in ﬁeld theory is possibly even more important than in particle mechanics. There are Lorentz symmetries, internal symmetries, gauge symmetries, supersymmetries.... We start here by recasting Noether’s theorem in a ﬁeld theoretic framework. 1.3.1 Noether’s Theorem Every continuous symmetry of the Lagrangian gives rise to a conserved current jµ(x) such that the equations of motion imply\n\n∂µj µ = 0 (1.29) or, in other words, ∂j 0/∂t + ∇·⃗j = 0. A Comment: A conserved current implies a conserved charge Q, deﬁned as Q = Z R3 d3x j 0 (1.30) which one can immediately see by taking the time derivative, 0 = − Z R3 d3x ∂j dQ dt = Z R3 d3x ∇·⃗j = 0 (1.31)\n\n∂t assuming that ⃗j →0 suﬃciently quickly as |⃗x| →∞. However, the existence of a current is a much stronger statement than the existence of a conserved charge because it implies that charge is conserved locally. To see this, we can deﬁne the charge in a ﬁnite volume V , QV = Z V d3x j 0 (1.32) Repeating the analysis above, we ﬁnd that dQV dt = − Z V d3x ∇·⃗j = − Z A ⃗j · d⃗S (1.33)\n\n– 13 – where A is the area bounding V and we have used Stokes’ theorem. This equation means that any charge leaving V must be accounted for by a ﬂow of the current 3vector ⃗j out of the volume. This kind of local conservation of charge holds in any local ﬁeld theory. Proof of Noether’s Theorem: We’ll prove the theorem by working inﬁnitesimally. We may always do this if we have a continuous symmetry. We say that the transformation\n\nδφa(x) = Xa(φ) (1.34) is a symmetry if the Lagrangian changes by a total derivative,\n\nδL = ∂µF µ (1.35) for some set of functions F µ(φ). To derive Noether’s theorem, we ﬁrst consider making an arbitrary transformation of the ﬁelds δφa. Then\n\nδL = ∂L\n\n∂φa δφa + ∂L ∂(∂µφa) ∂µ(δφa)\n\n= \u0014 ∂L\n\n\u0015 δφa + ∂µ\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µφa) δφa\n\n\u0013 (1.36)\n\n∂φa −∂µ ∂L ∂(∂µφa) When the equations of motion are satisﬁed, the term in square brackets vanishes. So we’re left with\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µφa) δφa\n\n\u0013 (1.37)\n\nδL = ∂µ But for the symmetry transformation δφa = Xa(φ), we have by deﬁnition δL = ∂µF µ. Equating this expression with (1.37) gives us the result\n\n∂µj µ = 0 with jµ = ∂L ∂(∂µφa) Xa(φ) −F µ(φ) (1.38) 1.3.2 An Example: Translations and the Energy-Momentum Tensor Recall that in classical particle mechanics, invariance under spatial translations gives rise to the conservation of momentum, while invariance under time translations is responsible for the conservation of energy. We will now see something similar in ﬁeld theories. Consider the inﬁnitesimal translation xν →xν −ϵν ⇒ φa(x) →φa(x) + ϵν∂νφa(x) (1.39)\n\n– 14 – (where the sign in the ﬁeld transformation is plus, instead of minus, because we’re doing an active, as opposed to passive, transformation). Similarly, once we substitute a speciﬁc ﬁeld conﬁguration φ(x) into the Lagrangian, the Lagrangian itself also transforms as L(x) →L(x) + ϵν∂νL(x) (1.40) Since the change in the Lagrangian is a total derivative, we may invoke Noether’s theorem which gives us four conserved currents (jµ)ν, one for each of the translations ϵν with ν = 0, 1, 2, 3, (jµ)ν = ∂L ∂(∂µφa) ∂νφa −δµ ν L ≡T µ ν (1.41) T µ ν is called the energy-momentum tensor. It satisﬁes\n\n∂µT µ ν = 0 (1.42) The four conserved quantities are given by E = Z d3x T 00 and P i = Z d3x T 0i (1.43) where E is the total energy of the ﬁeld conﬁguration, while P i is the total momentum of the ﬁeld conﬁguration. An Example of the Energy-Momentum Tensor Consider the simplest scalar ﬁeld theory with Lagrangian (1.7). From the above discussion, we can compute T µν = ∂µφ ∂νφ −ηµνL (1.44) One can verify using the equation of motion for φ that this expression indeed satisﬁes ∂µT µν = 0. For this example, the conserved energy and momentum are given by E = Z d3x 1 2 ˙φ2 + 1 2(∇φ)2 + 1 2m2φ2 (1.45) P i = Z d3x ˙φ ∂iφ (1.46) Notice that for this example, T µν came out symmetric, so that T µν = T νµ. This won’t always be the case. Nevertheless, there is typically a way to massage the energy momentum tensor of any theory into a symmetric form by adding an extra term\n\nΘµν = T µν + ∂ρΓρµν (1.47) where Γρµν is some function of the ﬁelds that is anti-symmetric in the ﬁrst two indices so Γρµν = −Γµρν. This guarantees that ∂µ∂ρΓρµν = 0 so that the new energy-momentum tensor is also a conserved current.\n\n– 15 – A Cute Trick One reason that you may want a symmetric energy-momentum tensor is to make contact with general relativity: such an object sits on the right-hand side of Einstein’s ﬁeld equations. In fact this observation provides a quick and easy way to determine a symmetric energy-momentum tensor. Firstly consider coupling the theory to a curved background spacetime, introducing an arbitrary metric gµν(x) in place of ηµν, and replacing the kinetic terms with suitable covariant derivatives using “minimal coupling”. Then a symmetric energy momentum tensor in the ﬂat space theory is given by\n\nΘµν = − 2 √−g ∂(√−gL) gµν=ηµν (1.48)\n\n∂gµν It should be noted however that this trick requires a little more care when working with spinors. 1.3.3 Another Example: Lorentz Transformations and Angular Momentum In classical particle mechanics, rotational invariance gave rise to conservation of angular momentum. What is the analogy in ﬁeld theory? Moreover, we now have further Lorentz transformations, namely boosts. What conserved quantity do they correspond to? To answer these questions, we ﬁrst need the inﬁnitesimal form of the Lorentz transformations\n\nΛµ ν = δµ ν + ωµ ν (1.49) where ωµ ν is inﬁnitesimal. The condition (1.24) for Λ to be a Lorentz transformation becomes (δµ σ + ωµ σ)(δν τ + ων τ) ηστ = ηµν\n\n⇒ ωµν + ωνµ = 0 (1.50) So the inﬁnitesimal form ωµν of the Lorentz transformation must be an anti-symmetric matrix. As a check, the number of diﬀerent 4×4 anti-symmetric matrices is 4×3/2 = 6, which agrees with the number of diﬀerent Lorentz transformations (3 rotations + 3 boosts). Now the transformation on a scalar ﬁeld is given by\n\nφ(x) →φ′(x) = φ(Λ−1x)\n\n= φ(xµ −ωµ νxν)\n\n= φ(xµ) −ωµ ν xν ∂µφ(x) (1.51)\n\n– 16 – from which we see that\n\nδφ = −ωµ νxν∂µφ (1.52) By the same argument, the Lagrangian density transforms as\n\nδL = −ωµ νxν∂µL = −∂µ(ωµ νxνL) (1.53) where the last equality follows because ωµ µ = 0 due to anti-symmetry. Once again, the Lagrangian changes by a total derivative so we may apply Noether’s theorem (now with F µ = −ωµ νxνL) to ﬁnd the conserved current j µ = − ∂L ∂(∂µφ) ωρ νxν ∂ρφ + ωµ ν xνL\n\n\u0014 ∂L ∂(∂µφ) xν ∂ρφ −δµ ρ xν L \u0015 = −ωρ ν T µ ρxν (1.54)\n\n= −ωρ ν Unlike in the previous example, I’ve left the inﬁnitesimal choice of ωµ ν in the expression for this current. But really, we should strip it out to give six diﬀerent currents, i.e. one for each choice of ωµ ν. We can write them as (J µ)ρσ = xρT µσ −xσT µρ (1.55) which satisfy ∂µ(J µ)ρσ = 0 and give rise to 6 conserved charges. For ρ, σ = 1, 2, 3, the Lorentz transformation is a rotation and the three conserved charges give the total angular momentum of the ﬁeld. Qij = Z d3x (xiT 0j −xjT 0i) (1.56) But what about the boosts? In this case, the conserved charges are Q0i = Z d3x (x0T 0i −xiT 00) (1.57) The fact that these are conserved tells us that dt = Z d3x T 0i + t Z d3x ∂T 0i 0 = dQ0i\n\n∂t −d Z d3x xiT 00 dt\n\n= P i + tdP i dt −d Z d3x xiT 00 (1.58) dt But we know that P i is conserved, so dP i/dt = 0, leaving us with the following consequence of invariance under boosts: d dt Z d3x xiT 00 = constant (1.59) This is the statement that the center of energy of the ﬁeld travels with a constant velocity. It’s kind of like a ﬁeld theoretic version of Newton’s ﬁrst law but, rather surprisingly, appearing here as a conservation law.\n\n– 17 – 1.3.4 Internal Symmetries The above two examples involved transformations of spacetime, as well as transformations of the ﬁeld. An internal symmetry is one that only involves a transformation of the ﬁelds and acts the same at every point in spacetime. The simplest example occurs for a complex scalar ﬁeld ψ(x) = (φ1(x) + iφ2(x))/ √ 2. We can build a real Lagrangian by L = ∂µψ⋆∂µψ −V (|ψ|2) (1.60) where the potential is a general polynomial in |ψ|2 = ψ⋆ψ. To ﬁnd the equations of motion, we could expand ψ in terms of φ1 and φ2 and work as before. However, it’s easier (and equivalent) to treat ψ and ψ⋆as independent variables and vary the action with respect to both of them. For example, varying with respect to ψ⋆leads to the equation of motion\n\n∂µ∂µψ + ∂V (ψ⋆ψ)\n\n∂ψ⋆ = 0 (1.61) The Lagrangian has a continuous symmetry which rotates φ1 and φ2 or, equivalently, rotates the phase of ψ:\n\nψ →eiαψ or δψ = iαψ (1.62) where the latter equation holds with α inﬁnitesimal. The Lagrangian remains invariant under this change: δL = 0. The associated conserved current is j µ = i(∂µψ⋆)ψ −iψ⋆(∂µψ) (1.63) We will later see that the conserved charges arising from currents of this type have the interpretation of electric charge or particle number (for example, baryon or lepton number). Non-Abelian Internal Symmetries Consider a theory involving N scalar ﬁelds φa, all with the same mass and the Lagrangian\n\n!2 N X N X N X L = 1 a=1 ∂µφa∂µφa −1 a=1 m2φ2 a −g a=1 φ2 a (1.64) 2 2 In this case the Lagrangian is invariant under the non-Abelian symmetry group G = SO(N). (Actually O(N) in this case). One can construct theories from complex ﬁelds in a similar manner that are invariant under an SU(N) symmetry group. Non-Abelian symmetries of this type are often referred to as global symmetries to distinguish them from the “local gauge” symmetries that you will meet later. Isospin is an example of such a symmetry, albeit realized only approximately in Nature.\n\n– 18 – Another Cute Trick There is a quick method to determine the conserved current associated to an internal symmetry δφ = αφ for which the Lagrangian is invariant. Here, α is a constant real number. (We may generalize the discussion easily to a non-Abelian internal symmetry for which α becomes a matrix). Now consider performing the transformation but where α depends on spacetime: α = α(x). The action is no longer invariant. However, the change must be of the form\n\nδL = (∂µα) hµ(φ) (1.65) since we know that δL = 0 when α is constant. The change in the action is therefore\n\nδS = Z d4x δL = − Z d4x α(x) ∂µhµ (1.66) which means that when the equations of motion are satisﬁed (so δS = 0 for all variations, including δφ = α(x)φ) we have\n\n∂µhµ = 0 (1.67) We see that we can identify the function hµ = j µ as the conserved current. This way of viewing things emphasizes that it is the derivative terms, not the potential terms, in the action that contribute to the current. (The potential terms are invariant even when α = α(x)). 1.4 The Hamiltonian Formalism The link between the Lagrangian formalism and the quantum theory goes via the path integral. In this course we will not discuss path integral methods, and focus instead on canonical quantization. For this we need the Hamiltonian formalism of ﬁeld theory. We start by deﬁning the momentum πa(x) conjugate to φa(x),\n\nπa(x) = ∂L\n\n∂˙φa (1.68) The conjugate momentum πa(x) is a function of x, just like the ﬁeld φa(x) itself. It is not to be confused with the total momentum P i deﬁned in (1.43) which is a single number characterizing the whole ﬁeld conﬁguration. The Hamiltonian density is given by H = πa(x) ˙φa(x) −L(x) (1.69) where, as in classical mechanics, we eliminate ˙φa(x) in favour of πa(x) everywhere in H. The Hamiltonian is then simply H = Z d3x H (1.70)\n\n– 19 – An Example: A Real Scalar Field For the Lagrangian 2(∇φ)2 −V (φ) (1.71) 2 ˙φ2 −1 L = 1 the momentum is given by π = ˙φ, which gives us the Hamiltonian, H = Z d3x 1 2π2 + 1 2(∇φ)2 + V (φ) (1.72) Notice that the Hamiltonian agrees with the deﬁnition of the total energy (1.45) that we get from applying Noether’s theorem for time translation invariance. In the Lagrangian formalism, Lorentz invariance is clear for all to see since the action is invariant under Lorentz transformations. In contrast, the Hamiltonian formalism is not manifestly Lorentz invariant: we have picked a preferred time. For example, the equations of motion for φ(x) = φ(⃗x, t) arise from Hamilton’s equations,\n\n˙φ(⃗x, t) = ∂H ∂π(⃗x, t) and ˙π(⃗x, t) = − ∂H ∂φ(⃗x, t) (1.73) which, unlike the Euler-Lagrange equations (1.6), do not look Lorentz invariant. Nevertheless, even though the Hamiltonian framework doesn’t look Lorentz invariant, the physics must remain unchanged. If we start from a relativistic theory, all ﬁnal answers must be Lorentz invariant even if it’s not manifest at intermediate steps. We will pause at several points along the quantum route to check that this is indeed the case.\n\n– 20 – 2. Free Fields “The career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the harmonic oscillator in ever-increasing levels of abstraction.” Sidney Coleman 2.1 Canonical Quantization In quantum mechanics, canonical quantization is a recipe that takes us from the Hamiltonian formalism of classical dynamics to the quantum theory. The recipe tells us to take the generalized coordinates qa and their conjugate momenta pa and promote them to operators. The Poisson bracket structure of classical mechanics morphs into the structure of commutation relations between operators, so that, in units with ℏ= 1, [qa, qb] = [pa, pb] = 0 [qa, pb] = i δb a (2.1) In ﬁeld theory we do the same, now for the ﬁeld φa(⃗x) and its momentum conjugate πb(⃗x). Thus a quantum ﬁeld is an operator valued function of space obeying the commutation relations [φa(⃗x), φb(⃗y)] = [πa(⃗x), πb(⃗y)] = 0 [φa(⃗x), πb(⃗y)] = iδ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) δb a (2.2) Note that we’ve lost all track of Lorentz invariance since we have separated space ⃗x and time t. We are working in the Schr¨odinger picture so that the operators φa(⃗x) and πa(⃗x) do not depend on time at all — only on space. All time dependence sits in the states |ψ⟩which evolve by the usual Schr¨odinger equation id|ψ⟩ dt = H |ψ⟩ (2.3) We aren’t doing anything diﬀerent from usual quantum mechanics; we’re merely applying the old formalism to ﬁelds. Be warned however that the notation |ψ⟩for the state is deceptively simple: if you were to write the wavefunction in quantum ﬁeld theory, it would be a functional, that is a function of every possible conﬁguration of the ﬁeld φ. The typical information we want to know about a quantum theory is the spectrum of the Hamiltonian H. In quantum ﬁeld theories, this is usually very hard. One reason for this is that we have an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom — at least one for every point ⃗x in space. However, for certain theories — known as free theories — we can ﬁnd a way to write the dynamics such that each degree of freedom evolves independently\n\n– 21 – from all the others. Free ﬁeld theories typically have Lagrangians which are quadratic in the ﬁelds, so that the equations of motion are linear. For example, the simplest relativistic free theory is the classical Klein-Gordon (KG) equation for a real scalar ﬁeld φ(⃗x, t),\n\n∂µ∂µφ + m2φ = 0 (2.4) To exhibit the coordinates in which the degrees of freedom decouple from each other, we need only take the Fourier transform,\n\nφ(⃗x, t) = Z d3p (2π)3 ei⃗p·⃗x φ(⃗p, t) (2.5) Then φ(⃗p, t) satisﬁes \u0012 ∂2\n\n∂t2 + (⃗p 2 + m2) \u0013 φ(⃗p, t) = 0 (2.6) Thus, for each value of ⃗p, φ(⃗p, t) solves the equation of a harmonic oscillator vibrating at frequency\n\n⃗p 2 + m2 (2.7)\n\nω⃗p = + p We learn that the most general solution to the KG equation is a linear superposition of simple harmonic oscillators, each vibrating at a diﬀerent frequency with a diﬀerent amplitude. To quantize φ(⃗x, t) we must simply quantize this inﬁnite number of harmonic oscillators. Let’s recall how to do this. 2.1.1 The Simple Harmonic Oscillator Consider the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian 2p2 + 1 2ω2q2 (2.8) H = 1 with the canonical commutation relations [q, p] = i. To ﬁnd the spectrum we deﬁne the creation and annihilation operators (also known as raising/lowering operators, or sometimes ladder operators) 2ω p , a† = rω a = rω 2 q + i √ 2 q − i √ 2ω p (2.9) which can be easily inverted to give 2ω (a + a†) , p = −i rω q = 1 √ 2 (a −a†) (2.10)\n\n– 22 – Substituting into the above expressions we ﬁnd [a, a†] = 1 (2.11) while the Hamiltonian is given by 2ω(aa† + a†a) H = 1\n\n= ω(a†a + 1 2) (2.12) One can easily conﬁrm that the commutators between the Hamiltonian and the creation and annihilation operators are given by [H, a†] = ωa† and [H, a] = −ωa (2.13) These relations ensure that a and a† take us between energy eigenstates. Let |E⟩be an eigenstate with energy E, so that H |E⟩= E |E⟩. Then we can construct more eigenstates by acting with a and a†, Ha† |E⟩= (E + ω)a† |E⟩ , Ha |E⟩= (E −ω)a |E⟩ (2.14) So we ﬁnd that the system has a ladder of states with energies\n\n. . . , E −ω, E, E + ω, E + 2ω, . . . (2.15) If the energy is bounded below, there must be a ground state |0⟩which satisﬁes a |0⟩= 0. This has ground state energy (also known as zero point energy), H |0⟩= 1 2ω |0⟩ (2.16) Excited states then arise from repeated application of a†,\n\n|n⟩= (a†)n |0⟩ with H |n⟩= (n + 1 2)ω |n⟩ (2.17) where I’ve ignored the normalization of these states so, ⟨n| n⟩̸= 1. 2.2 The Free Scalar Field We now apply the quantization of the harmonic oscillator to the free scalar ﬁeld. We write φ and π as a linear sum of an inﬁnite number of creation and annihilation operators a† ⃗p and a⃗p, indexed by the 3-momentum ⃗p,\n\nφ(⃗x) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p2ω⃗p h a⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x + a† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗xi (2.18)\n\nπ(⃗x) = Z d3p (2π)3(−i) rω⃗p h a⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x −a† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗xi (2.19) 2\n\n– 23 – Claim: The commutation relations for φ and π are equivalent to the following commutation relations for a⃗p and a† ⃗p [φ(⃗x), π(⃗y)] = iδ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) ⇔ [a⃗p, a⃗q] = [a† ⃗p, a† ⃗q] = 0 [φ(⃗x), φ(⃗y)] = [π(⃗x), π(⃗y)] = 0 [a⃗p, a† ⃗q] = (2π)3δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (2.20) Proof: We’ll show this just one way. Assume that [a⃗p, a† ⃗q] = (2π)3δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q). Then [φ(⃗x), π(⃗y)] = Z d3p d3q (2π)6 (−i) rω⃗q\n\n\u0010 −[a⃗p, a† ⃗q] ei⃗p·⃗x−i⃗q·⃗y + [a† ⃗p, a⃗q] e−i⃗p·⃗x+i⃗q·⃗y\u0011 2\n\nω⃗p\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 (−i) 2 \u0000 −ei⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y) −ei⃗p·(⃗y−⃗x)\u0001 (2.21)\n\n= iδ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) □ The Hamiltonian Let’s now compute the Hamiltonian in terms of a⃗p and a† ⃗p. We have H = 1 Z d3x π2 + (∇φ)2 + m2φ2 2\n\n\u0014 − √ω⃗pω⃗q Z d3x d3p d3q\n\n= 1 2 (a⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x −a† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x)(a⃗q ei⃗q·⃗x −a† ⃗q e−i⃗q·⃗x) (2π)6 2\n\n+ 1 2√ω⃗pω⃗q (i⃗p a⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x −i⃗p a† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x) · (i⃗q a⃗q ei⃗q·⃗x −i⃗q a† ⃗q e−i⃗q·⃗x)\n\n+ m2 2√ω⃗pω⃗q (a⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x + a† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x)(a⃗q ei⃗q·⃗x + a† ⃗q e−i⃗q·⃗x) \u0015 Z d3p (2π)3 1 ω⃗p\n\n= 1 h (−ω2 ⃗p + ⃗p 2 + m2)(a⃗p a−⃗p + a† ⃗p a† −⃗p) + (ω2 ⃗p + ⃗p 2 + m2)(a⃗p a† ⃗p + a† ⃗p a⃗p) i 4 where in the second line we’ve used the expressions for φ and π given in (2.18) and (2.19); to get to the third line we’ve integrated over d3x to get delta-functions δ(3)(⃗p±⃗q) which, in turn, allow us to perform the d3q integral. Now using the expression for the frequency ω2 ⃗p = ⃗p 2 + m2, the ﬁrst term vanishes and we’re left with Z d3p (2π)3 ω⃗p h a⃗p a† ⃗p + a† ⃗p a⃗p i H = 1 2\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 ω⃗p h a† ⃗p a⃗p + 1 2(2π)3 δ(3)(0) i (2.22)\n\n– 24 – Hmmmm. We’ve found a delta-function, evaluated at zero where it has its inﬁnite spike. Moreover, the integral over ω⃗p diverges at large p. What to do? Let’s start by looking at the ground state where this inﬁnity ﬁrst becomes apparent. 2.3 The Vacuum Following our procedure for the harmonic oscillator, let’s deﬁne the vacuum |0⟩by insisting that it is annihilated by all a⃗p, a⃗p |0⟩= 0 ∀⃗p (2.23) With this deﬁnition, the energy E0 of the ground state comes from the second term in (2.22), H |0⟩≡E0 |0⟩= \u0014Z d3p 1 2 ω⃗p δ(3)(0) \u0015 | 0⟩= ∞|0⟩ (2.24) The subject of quantum ﬁeld theory is rife with inﬁnities. Each tells us something important, usually that we’re doing something wrong, or asking the wrong question. Let’s take some time to explore where this inﬁnity comes from and how we should deal with it. In fact there are two diﬀerent ∞’s lurking in the expression (2.24). The ﬁrst arises because space is inﬁnitely large. (Inﬁnities of this type are often referred to as infra-red divergences although in this case the ∞is so simple that it barely deserves this name). To extract out this inﬁnity, let’s consider putting the theory in a box with sides of length L. We impose periodic boundary conditions on the ﬁeld. Then, taking the limit where L →∞, we get Z L/2 Z L/2 (2π)3 δ(3)(0) = lim L→∞\n\n−L/2 d3x ei⃗x·⃗p ⃗p=0 = lim L→∞\n\n−L/2 d3x = V (2.25) where V is the volume of the box. So the δ(0) divergence arises because we’re computing the total energy, rather than the energy density E0. To ﬁnd E0 we can simply divide by the volume, V = Z d3p (2π)3 1 2 ω⃗p (2.26) E0 = E0 which is still inﬁnite. We recognize it as the sum of ground state energies for each harmonic oscillator. But E0 →∞due to the |⃗p| →∞limit of the integral. This is a high frequency — or short distance — inﬁnity known as an ultra-violet divergence. This divergence arises because of our hubris. We’ve assumed that our theory is valid to arbitrarily short distance scales, corresponding to arbitrarily high energies. This is clearly absurd. The integral should be cut-oﬀat high momentum in order to reﬂect the fact that our theory is likely to break down in some way.\n\n– 25 – We can deal with the inﬁnity in (2.24) in a more practical way. In physics we’re only interested in energy diﬀerences. There’s no way to measure E0 directly, so we can simply redeﬁne the Hamiltonian by subtracting oﬀthis inﬁnity, H = Z d3p (2π)3 ω⃗p a† ⃗p a⃗p (2.27) so that, with this new deﬁnition, H |0⟩= 0. In fact, the diﬀerence between this Hamiltonian and the previous one is merely an ordering ambiguity in moving from the classical theory to the quantum theory. For example, if we deﬁned the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator to be H = (1/2)(ωq −ip)(ωq +ip), which is classically the same as our original choice, then upon quantization it would naturally give H = ωa†a as in (2.27). This type of ordering ambiguity arises a lot in ﬁeld theories. We’ll come across a number of ways of dealing with it. The method that we’ve used above is called normal ordering. Deﬁnition: We write the normal ordered string of operators φ1(⃗x1) . . . φn(⃗xn) as\n\n: φ1(⃗x1) . . . φn(⃗xn) : (2.28) It is deﬁned to be the usual product with all annihilation operators a⃗p placed to the right. So, for the Hamiltonian, we could write (2.27) as\n\n: H := Z d3p (2π)3 ω⃗p a† ⃗p a⃗p (2.29) In the remainder of this section, we will normal order all operators in this manner. 2.3.1 The Cosmological Constant Above I wrote “there’s no way to measure E0 directly”. There is a BIG caveat here: gravity is supposed to see everything! The sum of all the zero point energies should contribute to the stress-energy tensor that appears on the right-hand side of Einstein’s equations. We expect them to appear as a cosmological constant Λ = E0/V , Rµν −1 2Rgµν = −8πGTµν + Λgµν (2.30) Current observation suggests that 70% of the energy density in the universe has the properties of a cosmological constant with Λ ∼(10−3eV )4. This is much smaller than other scales in particle physics. In particular, the Standard Model is valid at least up to 1012 eV . Why don’t the zero point energies of these ﬁelds contribute to Λ? Or, if they do, what cancels them to such high accuracy? This is the cosmological constant problem. No one knows the answer!\n\n– 26 – 2.3.2 The Casimir Eﬀect “I mentioned my results to Niels Bohr, during a walk. That is nice, he said, that is something new... and he mumbled something about zero-point energy.” Hendrik Casimir Using the normal ordering prescription we can happily set E0 = 0, while chanting the mantra that only energy diﬀerences can be measured. But we should be careful, for there is a situation where diﬀerences in the energy of vacuum ﬂuctuations themselves can be measured. To regulate the infra-red divergences, we’ll make the x1 direction periodic, with size L, and impose periodic boundary conditions such that\n\nφ(⃗x) = φ(⃗x + L⃗n) (2.31) with ⃗n = (1, 0, 0). We’ll leave y and z alone, but remember d that we should compute all physical quantities per unit area A. We insert two reﬂecting plates, separated by a distance d ≪L in the x1 direction. The plates are such that they impose φ(x) = 0 at the position of the plates. The presence of these plates aﬀects the Fourier decomposition of the ﬁeld and, in particular, means that the momentum of the ﬁeld inside the plates is quantized as L Figure 3:\n\n⃗p = \u0010nπ d , py, pz \u0011 n ∈Z+ (2.32) For a massless scalar ﬁeld, the ground state energy between the plates is Z dpydpz\n\n∞ X r\u0010nπ (2π)2 1 2 E(d)\n\n\u00112 + p2 y + p2 z (2.33) A = d n=1 while the energy outside the plates is E(L −d). The total energy is therefore E = E(d) + E(L −d) (2.34) which – at least naively – depends on d. If this naive guess is true, it would mean that there is a force on the plates due to the ﬂuctuations of the vacuum. This is the Casimir force, ﬁrst predicted in 1948 and observed 10 years later. In the real world, the eﬀect is due to the vacuum ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, with the boundary conditions imposed by conducting plates. Here we model this eﬀect with a scalar.\n\n– 27 – But there’s a problem. E is inﬁnite! What to do? The problem comes from the arbitrarily high momentum modes. We could regulate this in a number of diﬀerent ways. Physically one could argue that any real plate cannot reﬂect waves of arbitrarily high frequency: at some point, things begin to leak. Mathematically, we want to ﬁnd a way to neglect modes of momentum p ≫a−1 for some distance scale a ≪d, known as the ultra-violet (UV) cut-oﬀ. One way to do this is to change the integral (2.33) to, Z dpydpz\n\n∞ X r\u0010nπ\n\n!\n\nE(d) (2π)2 1 2\n\n\u00112 + p2 y + p2 z e−a q d ) 2+p2y+p2z (2.35) ( nπ A = d n=1 which has the property that as a →0, we regain the full, inﬁnite, expression (2.33). However (2.35) is ﬁnite, and gives us something we can easily work with. Of course, we made it ﬁnite in a rather ad-hoc manner and we better make sure that any physical quantity we calculate doesn’t depend on the UV cut-oﬀa, otherwise it’s not something we can really trust. The integral (2.35) is do-able, but a little complicated. It’s a lot simpler if we look at the problem in d = 1 + 1 dimensions, rather than d = 3 + 1 dimensions. We’ll ﬁnd that all the same physics is at play. Now the energy is given by\n\n∞ X E1+1(d) = π n=1 n (2.36) 2d We now regulate this sum by introducing the UV cutoﬀa introduced above. This renders the expression ﬁnite, allowing us to start manipulating it thus,\n\n∞ X E1+1(d) →π n=1 n e−anπ/d 2d\n\n∞ X\n\n= −1 2 ∂ ∂a n=1 e−anπ/d\n\n= −1 2 ∂ ∂a 1 1 −e−aπ/d 2d eaπ/d\n\n= π (eaπ/d −1)2\n\n= d 2πa2 −π 24d + O(a2) (2.37) where, in the last line, we’ve used the fact that a ≪d. We can now compute the full energy,\n\n\u00121\n\n\u0013 + O(a2) (2.38) E1+1 = E1+1(d) + E1+1(L −d) = L 2πa2 −π d + 1 L −d 24\n\n– 28 – This is still inﬁnite in the limit a →0, which is to be expected. However, the force is given by\n\n∂E1+1\n\n∂d = π 24d2 + . . . (2.39) where the . . . include terms of size d/L and a/d. The key point is that as we remove both the regulators, and take a →0 and L →∞, the force between the plates remains ﬁnite. This is the Casimir force2. If we ploughed through the analogous calculation in d = 3 + 1 dimensions, and performed the integral (2.35), we would ﬁnd the result\n\n∂d = π2 1 A ∂E 480d4 (2.40) The true Casimir force is twice as large as this, due to the two polarization states of the photon. 2.4 Particles Having dealt with the vacuum, we can now turn to the excitations of the ﬁeld. It’s easy to verify that [H, a† ⃗p] = ω⃗p a† ⃗p and [H, a⃗p] = −ω⃗p a⃗p (2.41) which means that, just as for the harmonic oscillator, we can construct energy eigenstates by acting on the vacuum |0⟩with a† ⃗p. Let\n\n|⃗p⟩= a† ⃗p |0⟩ (2.42) This state has energy H |⃗p⟩= ω⃗p |⃗p⟩ with ω2 ⃗p = ⃗p 2 + m2 (2.43) But we recognize this as the relativistic dispersion relation for a particle of mass m and 3-momentum ⃗p, E2 ⃗p = ⃗p 2 + m2 (2.44) 2The number 24 that appears in the denominator of the one-dimensional Casimir force plays a more famous role in string theory: the same calculation in that context is the reason the bosonic string lives in 26 = 24 + 2 spacetime dimensions. (The +2 comes from the fact the string itself is extended in one space and one time dimension). You will need to attend next term’s “String Theory” course to see what on earth this has to do with the Casimir force.\n\n– 29 – We interpret the state |⃗p⟩as the momentum eigenstate of a single particle of mass m. To stress this, from now on we’ll write E⃗p everywhere instead of ω⃗p. Let’s check this particle interpretation by studying the other quantum numbers of |⃗p⟩. We may take the classical total momentum ⃗P given in (1.46) and turn it into an operator. After normal ordering, it becomes\n\n⃗P = − Z d3x π ⃗∇φ = Z d3p (2π)3 ⃗p a† ⃗p a⃗p (2.45) Acting on our state |⃗p⟩with ⃗P, we learn that it is indeed an eigenstate,\n\n⃗P |⃗p⟩= ⃗p |⃗p⟩ (2.46) telling us that the state |⃗p⟩has momentum ⃗p. Another property of |⃗p⟩that we can study is its angular momentum. Once again, we may take the classical expression for the total angular momentum of the ﬁeld (1.55) and turn it into an operator, Ji = ϵijk Z d3x (J 0)jk (2.47) It’s not hard to show that acting on the one-particle state with zero momentum, Ji |⃗p = 0⟩= 0, which we interpret as telling us that the particle carries no internal angular momentum. In other words, quantizing a scalar ﬁeld gives rise to a spin 0 particle. Multi-Particle States, Bosonic Statistics and Fock Space We can create multi-particle states by acting multiple times with a†’s. We interpret the state in which n a†’s act on the vacuum as an n-particle state,\n\n|⃗p1, . . . , ⃗pn⟩= a† ⃗p1 . . . a† ⃗pn |0⟩ (2.48) Because all the a†’s commute among themselves, the state is symmetric under exchange of any two particles. For example,\n\n|⃗p, ⃗q⟩= |⃗q, ⃗p⟩ (2.49) This means that the particles are bosons. The full Hilbert space of our theory is spanned by acting on the vacuum with all possible combinations of a†’s,\n\n|0⟩, a† ⃗p |0⟩, a† ⃗p a† ⃗q |0⟩, a† ⃗p a† ⃗q a† ⃗r |0⟩. . . (2.50)\n\n– 30 – This space is known as a Fock space. The Fock space is simply the sum of the n-particle Hilbert spaces, for all n ≥0. There is a useful operator which counts the number of particles in a given state in the Fock space. It is called the number operator N N = Z d3p (2π)3 a† ⃗p a⃗p (2.51) and satisﬁes N |⃗p1, . . . , ⃗pn⟩= n |⃗p1, . . . , ⃗pn⟩. The number operator commutes with the Hamiltonian, [N, H] = 0, ensuring that particle number is conserved. This means that we can place ourselves in the n-particle sector, and stay there. This is a property of free theories, but will no longer be true when we consider interactions: interactions create and destroy particles, taking us between the diﬀerent sectors in the Fock space. Operator Valued Distributions Although we’re referring to the states |⃗p⟩as “particles”, they’re not localized in space in any way — they are momentum eigenstates. Recall that in quantum mechanics the position and momentum eigenstates are not good elements of the Hilbert space since they are not normalizable (they normalize to delta-functions). Similarly, in quantum ﬁeld theory neither the operators φ(⃗x), nor a⃗p are good operators acting on the Fock space. This is because they don’t produce normalizable states. For example,\n\n⟨0| a⃗p a† ⃗p |0⟩= ⟨⃗p| ⃗p⟩= (2π)3δ(0) and ⟨0|φ(⃗x) φ(⃗x) |0⟩= ⟨⃗x| ⃗x⟩= δ(0) (2.52) They are operator valued distributions, rather than functions. This means that although φ(⃗x) has a well deﬁned vacuum expectation value, ⟨0| φ(⃗x) |0⟩= 0, the ﬂuctuations of the operator at a ﬁxed point are inﬁnite, ⟨0| φ(⃗x)φ(⃗x) |0⟩= ∞. We can construct well deﬁned operators by smearing these distributions over space. For example, we can create a wavepacket\n\n|ϕ⟩= Z d3p (2π)3 e−i⃗p·⃗x ϕ(⃗p) |⃗p⟩ (2.53) which is partially localized in both position and momentum space. (A typical state might be described by the Gaussian ϕ(⃗p) = exp(−⃗p 2/2m2)). 2.4.1 Relativistic Normalization We have deﬁned the vacuum |0⟩which we normalize as ⟨0| 0⟩= 1. The one-particle states |⃗p⟩= a† ⃗p |0⟩then satisfy\n\n⟨⃗p| ⃗q⟩= (2π)3 δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (2.54)\n\n– 31 – But is this Lorentz invariant? It’s not obvious because we only have 3-vectors. What could go wrong? Suppose we have a Lorentz transformation p µ →(p′)µ = Λµ νp ν (2.55) such that the 3-vector transforms as ⃗p →⃗p ′. In the quantum theory, it would be preferable if the two states are related by a unitary transformation,\n\n|⃗p⟩→|⃗p ′⟩= U(Λ) |⃗p⟩ (2.56) This would mean that the normalizations of |⃗p⟩and |⃗p ′⟩are the same whenever ⃗p and ⃗p ′ are related by a Lorentz transformation. But we haven’t been at all careful with normalizations. In general, we could get\n\n|⃗p⟩→λ(⃗p, ⃗p ′) |⃗p ′⟩ (2.57) for some unknown function λ(⃗p, ⃗p ′). How do we ﬁgure this out? The trick is to look at an object which we know is Lorentz invariant. One such object is the identity operator on one-particle states (which is really the projection operator onto one-particle states). With the normalization (2.54) we know this is given by 1 = Z d3p (2π)3 |⃗p⟩⟨⃗p| (2.58) This operator is Lorentz invariant, but it consists of two terms: the measure R d3p and the projector |⃗p⟩⟨⃗p|. Are these individually Lorentz invariant? In fact the answer is no. Claim The Lorentz invariant measure is, Z d3p 2E⃗p (2.59) Proof: R d4p is obviously Lorentz invariant. And the relativistic dispersion relation for a massive particle, pµpµ = m2 ⇒ p 2 0 = E2 ⃗p = ⃗p 2 + m2 (2.60) is also Lorentz invariant. Solving for p0, there are two branches of solutions: p0 = ±E⃗p. But the choice of branch is another Lorentz invariant concept. So piecing everything together, the following combination must be Lorentz invariant, Z d4p δ(p2 0 −⃗p 2 −m2) p0>0 = Z d3p p0=E⃗p (2.61) 2p0 which completes the proof. □\n\n– 32 – From this result we can ﬁgure out everything else. For example, the Lorentz invariant δ-function for 3-vectors is 2E⃗p δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (2.62) which follows because Z d3p 2E⃗p 2E⃗p δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) = 1 (2.63) So ﬁnally we learn that the relativistically normalized momentum states are given by 2E⃗p a† ⃗p |0⟩ (2.64)\n\n|p⟩= p 2E⃗p |⃗p⟩= p Notice that our notation is rather subtle: the relativistically normalized momentum state |p⟩diﬀers from |⃗p⟩by the factor p 2E⃗p. These states now satisfy\n\n⟨p| q⟩= (2π)3 2E⃗p δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (2.65) Finally, we can rewrite the identity on one-particle states as 1 = Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p |p⟩⟨p| (2.66) 2E⃗p a† ⃗p. We won’t make use of this notation here. Some texts also deﬁne relativistically normalized creation operators by a†(p) = p 2.5 Complex Scalar Fields Consider a complex scalar ﬁeld ψ(x) with Lagrangian L = ∂µψ⋆∂µψ −M 2ψ⋆ψ (2.67) Notice that, in contrast to the Lagrangian (1.7) for a real scalar ﬁeld, there is no factor of 1/2 in front of the Lagrangian for a complex scalar ﬁeld. If we write ψ in terms of real scalar ﬁelds by ψ = (φ1 + iφ2)/ √ 2, we get the factor of 1/2 coming from the 1/ √ 2’s. The equations of motion are\n\n∂µ∂µ ψ + M 2ψ = 0\n\n∂µ∂µψ⋆+ M 2ψ⋆= 0 (2.68) where the second equation is the complex conjugate of the ﬁrst. We expand the complex ﬁeld operator as a sum of plane waves as\n\nψ = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p\n\n\u0010 b⃗p e+i⃗p·⃗x + c† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x\u0011 2E⃗p\n\nψ† = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p\n\n\u0010 b† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x + c⃗p e+i⃗p·⃗x\u0011 (2.69) 2E⃗p\n\n– 33 – Since the classical ﬁeld ψ is not real, the corresponding quantum ﬁeld ψ is not hermitian. This is the reason that we have diﬀerent operators b and c† appearing in the positive and negative frequency parts. The classical ﬁeld momentum is π = ∂L/∂˙ψ = ˙ψ⋆. We also turn this into a quantum operator ﬁeld which we write as, r\n\nπ = Z d3p (2π)3 i E⃗p\n\n\u0010 b† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x −c⃗p e+i⃗p·⃗x\u0011 2 r\n\nπ† = Z d3p (2π)3 (−i) E⃗p\n\n\u0010 b⃗p e+i⃗p·⃗x −c† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x\u0011 (2.70) 2 The commutation relations between ﬁelds and momenta are given by [ψ(⃗x), π(⃗y)] = iδ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) and [ψ(⃗x), π†(⃗y)] = 0 (2.71) together with others related by complex conjugation, as well as the usual [ψ(⃗x), ψ(⃗y)] = [ψ(⃗x), ψ†(⃗y)] = 0, etc. One can easily check that these ﬁeld commutation relations are equivalent to the commutation relations for the operators b⃗p and c⃗p, [b⃗p, b† ⃗q] = (2π)3 δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) [c⃗p, c† ⃗q] = (2π)3 δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (2.72) and [b⃗p, b⃗q] = [c⃗p, c⃗q] = [b⃗p, c⃗q] = [b⃗p, c† ⃗q] = 0 (2.73) In summary, quantizing a complex scalar ﬁeld gives rise to two creation operators, b† ⃗p and c† ⃗p. These have the interpretation of creating two types of particle, both of mass M and both spin zero. They are interpreted as particles and anti-particles. In contrast, for a real scalar ﬁeld there is only a single type of particle: for a real scalar ﬁeld, the particle is its own antiparticle. Recall that the theory (2.67) has a classical conserved charge Q = i Z d3x ( ˙ψ⋆ψ −ψ⋆˙ψ) = i Z d3x (πψ −ψ⋆π⋆) (2.74) After normal ordering, this becomes the quantum operator Q = Z d3p (2π)3 (c† ⃗p c⃗p −b† ⃗p b⃗p) = Nc −Nb (2.75) so Q counts the number of anti-particles (created by c†) minus the number of particles (created by b†). We have [H, Q] = 0, ensuring that Q is conserved quantity in the quantum theory. Of course, in our free ﬁeld theory this isn’t such a big deal because both Nc and Nb are separately conserved. However, we’ll soon see that in interacting theories Q survives as a conserved quantity, while Nc and Nb individually do not.\n\n– 34 – 2.6 The Heisenberg Picture Although we started with a Lorentz invariant Lagrangian, we slowly butchered it as we quantized, introducing a preferred time coordinate t. It’s not at all obvious that the theory is still Lorentz invariant after quantization. For example, the operators φ(⃗x) depend on space, but not on time. Meanwhile, the one-particle states evolve in time by Schr¨odinger’s equation, id |⃗p(t)⟩ dt = H |⃗p(t)⟩ ⇒ |⃗p(t)⟩= e−iE⃗p t |⃗p⟩ (2.76) Things start to look better in the Heisenberg picture where time dependence is assigned to the operators O, OH = eiHt OS e−iHt (2.77) so that dOH dt = i[H, OH] (2.78) where the subscripts S and H tell us whether the operator is in the Schr¨odinger or Heisenberg picture. In ﬁeld theory, we drop these subscripts and we will denote the picture by specifying whether the ﬁelds depend on space φ(⃗x) (the Schr¨odinger picture) or spacetime φ(⃗x, t) = φ(x) (the Heisenberg picture). The operators in the two pictures agree at a ﬁxed time, say, t = 0. The commutation relations (2.2) become equal time commutation relations in the Heisenberg picture, [φ(⃗x, t), φ(⃗y, t)] = [π(⃗x, t), π(⃗y, t)] = 0 [φ(⃗x, t), π(⃗y, t)] = iδ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (2.79) Now that the operator φ(x) = φ(⃗x, t) depends on time, we can start to study how it evolves. For example, we have\n\n˙φ = i[H, φ] = i 2[ Z d3y π(y)2 + ∇φ(y)2 + m2φ(y)2 , φ(x)]\n\n= i Z d3y π(y) (−i) δ(3)(⃗y −⃗x) = π(x) (2.80) Meanwhile, the equation of motion for π reads,\n\n˙π = i[H, π] = i 2 [ Z d3y π(y)2 + ∇φ(y)2 + m2φ(y)2 , π(x)]\n\n– 35 –\n\n= i Z d3y (∇y[φ(y), π(x)]) ∇φ(y) + ∇φ(y) ∇y[φ(y), π(x)] 2\n\n+2im2φ(y) δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y)\n\n= − \u0012Z d3y \u0000 ∇y δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) \u0001 ∇yφ(y) \u0013 −m2φ(x)\n\n= ∇2φ −m2φ (2.81) where we’ve included the subscript y on ∇y when there may be some confusion about which argument the derivative is acting on. To reach the last line, we’ve simply integrated by parts. Putting (2.80) and (2.81) together we ﬁnd that the ﬁeld operator φ satisﬁes the Klein-Gordon equation\n\n∂µ∂µφ + m2φ = 0 (2.82) Things are beginning to look more relativistic. We can write the Fourier expansion of φ(x) by using the deﬁnition (2.77) and noting, eiHt a⃗p e−iHt = e−iE⃗p t a⃗p and eiHt a† ⃗p e−iHt = e+iE⃗p t a† ⃗p (2.83) which follows from the commutation relations [H, a⃗p ] = −E⃗p a⃗p and [H, a† ⃗p ] = +E⃗p a† ⃗p. This then gives,\n\nφ(⃗x, t) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p\n\n\u0010 a⃗p e−ip·x + a† ⃗p e+ip·x\u0011 (2.84) 2E⃗p which looks very similar to the previous expansion (2.18) t except that the exponent is now written in terms of 4vectors, p · x = E⃗p t −⃗p · ⃗x. (Note also that a sign has ﬂipped in the exponent due to our Minkowski metric contraction). It’s simple to check that (2.84) indeed satisﬁes the Klein-Gordon equation (2.82). O 2 O 1 x 2.6.1 Causality Figure 4: We’re approaching something Lorentz invariant in the Heisenberg picture, where φ(x) now satisﬁes the KleinGordon equation. But there’s still a hint of non-Lorentz invariance because φ and π satisfy equal time commutation relations, [φ(⃗x, t), π(⃗y, t)] = iδ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (2.85)\n\n– 36 – But what about arbitrary spacetime separations? In particular, for our theory to be causal, we must require that all spacelike separated operators commute, [O1(x), O2(y)] = 0 ∀(x −y)2 < 0 (2.86) This ensures that a measurement at x cannot aﬀect a measurement at y when x and y are not causally connected. Does our theory satisfy this crucial property? Let’s deﬁne\n\n∆(x −y) = [φ(x), φ(y)] (2.87) The objects on the right-hand side of this expression are operators. However, it’s easy to check by direct substitution that the left-hand side is simply a c-number function with the integral expression\n\n∆(x −y) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p\n\n\u0000 e−ip·(x−y) −eip·(x−y)\u0001 (2.88) What do we know about this function?\n\n• It’s Lorentz invariant, thanks to the appearance of the Lorentz invariant measure R d3p/2E⃗p that we introduced in (2.59).\n\n• It doesn’t vanish for timelike separation. For example, taking x −y = (t, 0, 0, 0) gives [φ(⃗x, 0), φ(⃗x, t)] ∼e−imt −e+imt.\n\n• It vanishes for space-like separations. This follows by noting that ∆(x −y) = 0 at equal times for all (x −y)2 = −(⃗x −⃗y)2 < 0, which we can see explicitly by writing Z d3p (2π)3 1 p\n\n⃗p 2 + m2 \u0000 ei⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y) −e−i⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y)\u0001 (2.89) [φ(⃗x, t), φ(⃗y, t)] = 1 2 and noticing that we can ﬂip the sign of ⃗p in the last exponent as it is an integration variable. But since ∆(x −y) Lorentz invariant, it can only depend on (x −y)2 and must therefore vanish for all (x −y)2 < 0. We therefore learn that our theory is indeed causal with commutators vanishing outside the lightcone. This property will continue to hold in interacting theories; indeed, it is usually given as one of the axioms of local quantum ﬁeld theories. I should mention however that the fact that [φ(x), φ(y)] is a c-number function, rather than an operator, is a property of free ﬁelds only.\n\n– 37 – 2.7 Propagators We could ask a diﬀerent question to probe the causal structure of the theory. Prepare a particle at spacetime point y. What is the amplitude to ﬁnd it at point x? We can calculate this:\n\n⟨0| φ(x)φ(y) |0⟩= Z d3p d3p ′ (2π)6 1 p 4E⃗pE⃗p ′ ⟨0| a⃗p a† ⃗p ′ | 0⟩e−ip·x+ip′·y\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p e−ip·(x−y) ≡D(x −y) (2.90) The function D(x−y) is called the propagator. For spacelike separations, (x−y)2 < 0, one can show that D(x −y) decays like D(x −y) ∼e−m|⃗x−⃗y| (2.91) So it decays exponentially quickly outside the lightcone but, nonetheless, is non-vanishing! The quantum ﬁeld appears to leak out of the lightcone. Yet we’ve just seen that spacelike measurements commute and the theory is causal. How do we reconcile these two facts? We can rewrite the calculation (2.89) as [φ(x), φ(y)] = D(x −y) −D(y −x) = 0 if (x −y)2 < 0 (2.92) There are words you can drape around this calculation. When (x −y)2 < 0, there is no Lorentz invariant way to order events. If a particle can travel in a spacelike direction from x →y, it can just as easily travel from y →x. In any measurement, the amplitudes for these two events cancel. With a complex scalar ﬁeld, it is more interesting. We can look at the equation [ψ(x), ψ†(y)] = 0 outside the lightcone. The interpretation now is that the amplitude for the particle to propagate from x →y cancels the amplitude for the antiparticle to travel from y →x. In fact, this interpretation is also there for a real scalar ﬁeld because the particle is its own antiparticle. 2.7.1 The Feynman Propagator As we will see shortly, one of the most important quantities in interacting ﬁeld theory is the Feynman propagator, ( D(x −y) x0 > y0\n\n∆F(x −y) = ⟨0| Tφ(x)φ(y) |0⟩= D(y −x) y0 > x0 (2.93)\n\n– 38 – where T stands for time ordering, placing all operators evaluated at later times to the left so, ( φ(x)φ(y) x0 > y0 Tφ(x)φ(y) =\n\nφ(y)φ(x) y0 > x0 (2.94) Claim: There is a useful way of writing the Feynman propagator in terms of a 4momentum integral.\n\n∆F(x −y) = Z d4p (2π)4 i p2 −m2 e−ip·(x−y) (2.95) Notice that this is the ﬁrst time in this course that we’ve integrated over 4-momentum. Until now, we integrated only over 3-momentum, with p0 ﬁxed by the mass-shell condition to be p0 = E⃗p. In the expression (2.95) for ∆F, we have no such condition on p0. However, as it stands this integral is ill-deﬁned because, for each value of ⃗p, the denominator p2−m2 = (p0)2−⃗p 2−m2 produces a pole when p0 = ±E⃗p = ± p\n\n⃗p 2 + m2. We need a prescription for avoiding these singularities in the p0 integral. To get the Feynman propagator, we must choose the contour to be Im(p ) 0 Re(p ) Ep − 0 E + p Figure 5: The contour for the Feynman propagator. Proof: 1 p2 −m2 = 1 (p0)2 −E2 ⃗p = 1 (p0 −E⃗p)(p0 + E⃗p) (2.96) so the residue of the pole at p0 = ±E⃗p is ±1/2E⃗p. When x0 > y0, we close the contour in the lower half plane, where p0 →−i∞, ensuring that the integrand vanishes since e−ip0(x0−y0) →0. The integral over p0 then picks up the residue at p0 = +E⃗p which is −2πi/2E⃗p where the minus sign arises because we took a clockwise contour. Hence when x0 > y0 we have\n\n∆F(x −y) = Z d3p (2π)4 −2πi 2E⃗p i e−iE⃗p(x0−y0)+i⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y)\n\n– 39 –\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p e−ip·(x−y) = D(x −y) (2.97) which is indeed the Feynman propagator for x0 > y0. In contrast, when y0 > x0, we close the contour in an anti-clockwise direction in the upper half plane to get,\n\n∆F(x −y) = Z d3p (2π)4 2πi (−2E⃗p) i e+iE⃗p(x0−y0)+i⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y)\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p e−iE⃗p(y0−x0)−i⃗p·(⃗y−⃗x)\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p e−ip·(y−x) = D(y −x) (2.98) where to go to from the second line to the third, we have ﬂipped the sign of ⃗p which is valid since we integrate over d3p and all other quantities depend only on ⃗p 2. Once again we reproduce the Feynman propagator. □ Instead of specifying the contour, it is standard to write Im(p ) 0 the Feynman propagator as\n\n∆F(x −y) = Z d4p (2π)4 ie−ip·(x−y)\n\n+ iε Re(p ) 0 p2 −m2 + iϵ (2.99) iε − with ϵ > 0, and inﬁnitesimal. This has the eﬀect of shifting the poles slightly oﬀthe real axis, so the integral along the real p0 axis is equivalent to the contour shown in Figure 5. This way of writing the propagator is, for obvious reasons, called the “iϵ prescription”. Figure 6: 2.7.2 Green’s Functions There is another avatar of the propagator: it is a Green’s function for the Klein-Gordon operator. If we stay away from the singularities, we have (∂2 t −∇2 + m2)∆F(x −y) = Z d4p (2π)4 i p2 −m2 (−p2 + m2) e−ip·(x−y)\n\n= −i Z d4p (2π)4 e−ip·(x−y)\n\n= −i δ(4)(x −y) (2.100) Note that we didn’t make use of the contour anywhere in this derivation. For some purposes it is also useful to pick other contours which also give rise to Green’s functions.\n\n– 40 – Im(p ) Im(p ) 0 0 0 Ep + Re(p ) Re(p ) Ep − 0 Ep − E + p Figure 7: The retarded contour Figure 8: The advanced contour For example, the retarded Green’s function ∆R(x −y) is deﬁned by the contour shown in Figure 7 which has the property ( D(x −y) −D(y −x) x0 > y0\n\n∆R(x −y) = 0 y0 > x0 (2.101) The retarded Green’s function is useful in classical ﬁeld theory if we know the initial value of some ﬁeld conﬁguration and want to ﬁgure out what it evolves into in the presence of a source, meaning that we want to know the solution to the inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation,\n\n∂µ∂µφ + m2φ = J(x) (2.102) for some ﬁxed background function J(x). Similarly, one can deﬁne the advanced Green’s function ∆A(x −y) which vanishes when y0 < x0, which is useful if we know the end point of a ﬁeld conﬁguration and want to ﬁgure out where it came from. Given that next term’s course is called “Advanced Quantum Field Theory”, there is an obvious name for the current course. But it got shot down in the staﬀmeeting. In the quantum theory, we will see that the Feynman Green’s function is most relevant. 2.8 Non-Relativistic Fields Let’s return to our classical complex scalar ﬁeld obeying the Klein-Gordon equation. We’ll decompose the ﬁeld as\n\nψ(⃗x, t) = e−imt ˜ψ(⃗x, t) (2.103) Then the KG-equation reads\n\n∂2 t ψ −∇2ψ + m2ψ = e−imt h¨˜ψ −2im ˙˜ψ −∇2 ˜ψ i = 0 (2.104) with the m2 term cancelled by the time derivatives. The non-relativistic limit of a particle is |⃗p| ≪m. Let’s look at what this does to our ﬁeld. After a Fourier transform,\n\n– 41 – this is equivalent to saying that |¨˜ψ| ≪m| ˙˜ψ|. In this limit, we drop the term with two time derivatives and the KG equation becomes, i∂˜ψ\n\n∂t = −1 2m∇2 ˜ψ (2.105) This looks very similar to the Schr¨odinger equation for a non-relativistic free particle of mass m. Except it doesn’t have any probability interpretation — it’s simply a classical ﬁeld evolving through an equation that’s ﬁrst order in time derivatives. We wrote down a Lagrangian in section 1.1.2 which gives rise to ﬁeld equations which are ﬁrst order in time derivatives. In fact, we can derive this from the relativistic Lagrangian for a scalar ﬁeld by again taking the limit ∂tψ ≪mψ. After losing the ˜ tilde, so ˜ψ →ψ, the non-relativistic Lagrangian becomes L = +iψ⋆˙ψ −1 2m ∇ψ⋆∇ψ (2.106) where we’ve divided by 1/2m. This Lagrangian has a conserved current arising from the internal symmetry ψ →eiαψ. The current has time and space components 2m(ψ⋆∇ψ −ψ∇ψ⋆) \u0013 (2.107) jµ = \u0012 −ψ⋆ψ, i To move to the Hamiltonian formalism we compute the momentum\n\nπ = ∂L\n\n∂˙ψ = iψ⋆ (2.108) This means that the momentum conjugate to ψ is iψ⋆. The momentum does not depend on time derivatives at all! This looks a little disconcerting but it’s fully consistent for a theory which is ﬁrst order in time derivatives. In order to determine the full trajectory of the ﬁeld, we need only specify ψ and ψ⋆at time t = 0: no time derivatives on the initial slice are required. Since the Lagrangian already contains a “p ˙q” term (instead of the more familiar 1 2p ˙q term), the time derivatives drop out when we compute the Hamiltonian. We get, H = 1 2m∇ψ⋆∇ψ (2.109) To quantize we impose (in the Schr¨odinger picture) the canonical commutation relations [ψ(⃗x), ψ(⃗y)] = [ψ†(⃗x), ψ†(⃗y)] = 0 [ψ(⃗x), ψ†(⃗y)] = δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (2.110)\n\n– 42 – We may expand ψ(⃗x) as a Fourier transform\n\nψ(⃗x) = Z d3p (2π)3 a⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x (2.111) where the commutation relations (2.110) require [a⃗p, a† ⃗q ] = (2π)3δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (2.112) The vacuum satisﬁes a⃗p |0⟩= 0, and the excitations are a† ⃗p1 . . . a† ⃗pn |0⟩. The one-particle states have energy H |⃗p⟩= ⃗p 2 2m |⃗p⟩ (2.113) which is the non-relativistic dispersion relation. We conclude that quantizing the ﬁrst order Lagrangian (2.106) gives rise to non-relativistic particles of mass m. Some comments:\n\n• We have a complex ﬁeld but only a single type of particle. The anti-particle is not in the spectrum. The existence of anti-particles is a consequence of relativity.\n\n• A related fact is that the conserved charge Q = R d3x : ψ†ψ : is the particle number. This remains conserved even if we include interactions in the Lagrangian of the form\n\n∆L = V (ψ⋆ψ) (2.114) So in non-relativistic theories, particle number is conserved. It is only with relativity, and the appearance of anti-particles, that particle number can change.\n\n• There is no non-relativistic limit of a real scalar ﬁeld. In the relativistic theory, the particles are their own anti-particles, and there can be no way to construct a multi-particle theory that conserves particle number. 2.8.1 Recovering Quantum Mechanics In quantum mechanics, we talk about the position and momentum operators ⃗X and ⃗P. In quantum ﬁeld theory, position is relegated to a label. How do we get back to quantum mechanics? We already have the operator for the total momentum of the ﬁeld\n\n⃗P = Z d3p (2π)3 ⃗p a† ⃗p a⃗p (2.115)\n\n– 43 – which, on one-particle states, gives ⃗P |⃗p⟩= ⃗p |⃗p⟩. It’s also easy to construct the position operator. Let’s work in the non-relativistic limit. Then the operator\n\nψ†(⃗x) = Z d3p (2π)3 a† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x (2.116) creates a particle with δ-function localization at ⃗x. We write |⃗x⟩= ψ†(⃗x) |0⟩. A natural position operator is then\n\n⃗X = Z d3x ⃗x ψ†(⃗x) ψ(⃗x) (2.117) so that ⃗X |⃗x⟩= ⃗x |⃗x⟩. Let’s now construct a state |ϕ⟩by taking superpositions of one-particle states |⃗x⟩,\n\n|ϕ⟩= Z d3x ϕ(⃗x) |⃗x⟩ (2.118) The function ϕ(⃗x) is what we would usually call the Schr¨odinger wavefunction (in the position representation). Let’s make sure that it indeed satisﬁes all the right properties. Firstly, it’s clear that acting with the position operator ⃗X has the right action of ϕ(⃗x), Xi |ϕ⟩= Z d3x xi ϕ(⃗x) |⃗x⟩ (2.119) but what about the momentum operator ⃗P? We will now show that\n\n\u0013 |⃗x⟩ (2.120) P i |ϕ⟩= Z d3x \u0012 −i ∂ϕ\n\n∂xi which tells us that P i acts as the familiar derivative on wavefunctions |ϕ⟩. To see that this is the case, we write P i |ϕ⟩= Z d3xd3p (2π)3 pia† ⃗pa⃗p ϕ(⃗x) ψ†(⃗x) |0⟩\n\n= Z d3xd3p (2π)3 pia† ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗x ϕ(⃗x) |0⟩ (2.121) where we’ve used the relationship [a⃗p, ψ†(⃗x)] = e−i⃗p·⃗x which can be easily checked. Proceeding with our calculation, we have P i |ϕ⟩= Z d3xd3p\n\n\u0012 i ∂\n\n∂xi e−i⃗p·⃗x \u0013 ϕ(⃗x) |0⟩ (2π)3 a† ⃗p\n\n= Z d3xd3p (2π)3 e−i⃗p·⃗x \u0012 −i ∂ϕ\n\n\u0013 a† ⃗p |0⟩\n\n∂xi\n\n= Z d3x \u0012 −i ∂ϕ\n\n\u0013 |⃗x⟩ (2.122)\n\n∂xi\n\n– 44 – which conﬁrms (2.120). So we learn that when acting on one-particle states, the operators ⃗X and ⃗P act as position and momentum operators in quantum mechanics, with [Xi, P j] |ϕ⟩= iδij |ϕ⟩. But what about dynamics? How does the wavefunction ϕ(⃗x, t) change in time? The Hamiltonian (2.109) can be rewritten as 2m ∇ψ⋆∇ψ = Z d3p (2π)3 ⃗p 2 H = Z d3x 1 2m a† ⃗p a⃗p (2.123) so we ﬁnd that\n\n∂t = −1 i∂ϕ 2m ∇2ϕ (2.124) But this is the same equation obeyed by the original ﬁeld (2.105)! Except this time, it really is the Schr¨odinger equation, complete with the usual probabilistic interpretation for the wavefunction ϕ. Note in particular that the conserved charge arising from the Noether current (2.107) is Q = R d3x |ϕ(⃗x)|2 which is the total probability. Historically, the fact that the equation for the classical ﬁeld (2.105) and the oneparticle wavefunction (2.124) coincide caused some confusion. It was thought that perhaps we are quantizing the wavefunction itself and the resulting name “second quantization” is still sometimes used today to mean quantum ﬁeld theory. It’s important to stress that, despite the name, we’re not quantizing anything twice! We simply quantize a classical ﬁeld once. Nonetheless, in practice it’s useful to know that if we treat the one-particle Schr¨odinger equation as the equation for a quantum ﬁeld then it will give the correct generalization to multi-particle states. Interactions Often in quantum mechanics, we’re interested in particles moving in some ﬁxed background potential V (⃗x). This can be easily incorporated into ﬁeld theory by working with a Lagrangian with explicit ⃗x dependence, L = iψ⋆˙ψ −1 2m ∇ψ⋆∇ψ −V (⃗x) ψ⋆ψ (2.125) Note that this Lagrangian doesn’t respect translational symmetry and we won’t have the associated energy-momentum tensor. While such Lagrangians are useful in condensed matter physics, we rarely (or never) come across them in high-energy physics, where all equations obey translational (and Lorentz) invariance.\n\n– 45 – One can also consider interactions between particles. Obviously these are only important for n particle states with n ≥2. We therefore expect them to arise from additions to the Lagrangian of the form\n\n∆L = ψ⋆(⃗x) ψ⋆(⃗x) ψ(⃗x) ψ(⃗x) (2.126) which, in the quantum theory, is an operator which destroys two particles before creating two new ones. Such terms in the Lagrangian will indeed lead to inter-particle forces, both in the non-relativistic and relativistic setting. In the next section we explore these types of interaction in detail for relativistic theories.\n\n– 46 – 3. Interacting Fields The free ﬁeld theories that we’ve discussed so far are very special: we can determine their spectrum, but nothing interesting then happens. They have particle excitations, but these particles don’t interact with each other. Here we’ll start to examine more complicated theories that include interaction terms. These will take the form of higher order terms in the Lagrangian. We’ll start by asking what kind of small perturbations we can add to the theory. For example, consider the Lagrangian for a real scalar ﬁeld, L = 1 2∂µφ ∂µφ −1\n\nλn 2m2φ2 − X n! φn (3.1) n≥3 The coeﬃcients λn are called coupling constants. What restrictions do we have on λn to ensure that the additional terms are small perturbations? You might think that we need simply make “λn ≪1”. But this isn’t quite right. To see why this is the case, let’s do some dimensional analysis. Firstly, note that the action has dimensions of angular momentum or, equivalently, the same dimensions as ℏ. Since we’ve set ℏ= 1, using the convention described in the introduction, we have [S] = 0. With S = R d4x L, and [d4x] = −4, the Lagrangian density must therefore have [L] = 4 (3.2) What does this mean for the Lagrangian (3.1)? Since [∂µ] = 1, we can read oﬀthe mass dimensions of all the factors to ﬁnd, [φ] = 1 , [m] = 1 , [λn] = 4 −n (3.3) So now we see why we can’t simply say we need λn ≪1, because this statement only makes sense for dimensionless quantities. The various terms, parameterized by λn, fall into three diﬀerent categories\n\n• [λ3] = 1: For this term, the dimensionless parameter is λ3/E, where E has dimensions of mass. Typically in quantum ﬁeld theory, E is the energy scale of the process of interest. This means that λ3 φ3/3! is a small perturbation at high energies E ≫λ3, but a large perturbation at low energies E ≪λ3. Terms that we add to the Lagrangian with this behavior are called relevant because they’re most relevant at low energies (which, after all, is where most of the physics we see lies). In a relativistic theory, E > m, so we can always make this perturbation small by taking λ3 ≪m.\n\n– 47 –\n\n• [λ4] = 0: this term is small if λ4 ≪1. Such perturbations are called marginal.\n\n• [λn] < 0 for n ≥5: The dimensionless parameter is (λnEn−4), which is small at low-energies and large at high energies. Such perturbations are called irrelevant. As you’ll see later, it is typically impossible to avoid high energy processes in quantum ﬁeld theory. (We’ve already seen a glimpse of this in computing the vacuum energy). This means that we might expect problems with irrelevant operators. Indeed, these lead to “non-renormalizable” ﬁeld theories in which one cannot make sense of the inﬁnities at arbitrarily high energies. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the theory is useless; just that it is incomplete at some energy scale. Let me note however that the naive assignment of relevant, marginal and irrelevant is not always ﬁxed in stone: quantum corrections can sometimes change the character of an operator. An Important Aside: Why QFT is Simple Typically in a quantum ﬁeld theory, only the relevant and marginal couplings are important. This is basically because, as we’ve seen above, the irrelevant couplings become small at low-energies. This is a huge help: of the inﬁnite number of interaction terms that we could write down, only a handful are actually needed (just two in the case of the real scalar ﬁeld described above). Let’s look at this a little more. Suppose that we some day discover the true superduper “theory of everything unimportant” that describes the world at very high energy scales, say the GUT scale, or the Planck scale. Whatever this scale is, let’s call it Λ. It is an energy scale, so [Λ] = 1. Now we want to understand the laws of physics down at our puny energy scale E ≪Λ. Let’s further suppose that down at the energy scale E, the laws of physics are described by a real scalar ﬁeld. (They’re not of course: they’re described by non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds and fermions, but the same argument applies in that case so bear with me). This scalar ﬁeld will have some complicated interaction terms (3.1), where the precise form is dictated by all the stuﬀthat’s going on in the high energy superduper theory. What are these interactions? Well, we could write our dimensionful coupling constants λn in terms of dimensionless couplings gn, multiplied by a suitable power of the relevant scale Λ,\n\nλn = gn Λn−4 (3.4) The exact values of dimensionless couplings gn depend on the details of the high-energy superduper theory, but typically one expects them to be of order 1: gn ∼O(1). This\n\n– 48 – means that for experiments at small energies E ≪Λ, the interaction terms of the form φn with n > 4 will be suppressed by powers of (E/Λ)n−4. This is usually a suppression by many orders of magnitude. (e.g for the energies E explored at the LHC, E/Mpl ∼10−16). It is this simple argument, based on dimensional analysis, that ensures that we need only focus on the ﬁrst few terms in the interaction: those which are relevant and marginal. It also means that if we only have access to low-energy experiments (which we do!), it’s going to be very diﬃcult to ﬁgure out the high energy theory (which it is!), because its eﬀects are highly diluted except for the relevant and marginal interactions. The discussion given above is a poor man’s version of the ideas of eﬀective ﬁeld theory and Wilson’s renormalization group, about which you can learn more in the “Statistical Field Theory” course. Examples of Weakly Coupled Theories In this course we’ll study only weakly coupled ﬁeld theories i.e. ones that can truly be considered as small perturbations of the free ﬁeld theory at all energies. In this section, we’ll look at two types of interactions 1) φ4 theory: 2∂µφ∂µφ −1 2m2φ2 −λ L = 1 4!φ4 (3.5) with λ ≪1. We can get a hint for what the eﬀects of this extra term will be. Expanding out φ4 in terms of a⃗p and a† ⃗p, we see a sum of interactions that look like a† ⃗p a† ⃗p a† ⃗p a† ⃗p and a† ⃗p a† ⃗p a† ⃗p a⃗p etc. (3.6) These will create and destroy particles. This suggests that the φ4 Lagrangian describes a theory in which particle number is not conserved. Indeed, we could check that the number operator N now satisﬁes [H, N] ̸= 0. 2) Scalar Yukawa Theory 2∂µφ∂µφ −M 2ψ⋆ψ −1 L = ∂µψ⋆∂µψ + 1 2m2φ2 −gψ⋆ψφ (3.7) with g ≪M, m. This theory couples a complex scalar ψ to a real scalar φ. While the individual particle numbers of ψ and φ are no longer conserved, we do still have a symmetry rotating the phase of ψ, ensuring the existence of the charge Q deﬁned in (2.75) such that [Q, H] = 0. This means that the number of ψ particles minus the number of ψ anti-particles is conserved. It is common practice to denote the antiparticle as ¯ψ.\n\n– 49 – The scalar Yukawa theory has a slightly worrying aspect: the potential has a stable local minimum at φ = ψ = 0, but is unbounded below for large enough −gφ. This means we shouldn’t try to push this theory too far. A Comment on Strongly Coupled Field Theories In this course we restrict attention to weakly coupled ﬁeld theories where we can use perturbative techniques. The study of strongly coupled ﬁeld theories is much more diﬃcult, and one of the major research areas in theoretical physics. For example, some of the amazing things that can happen include\n\n• Charge Fractionalization: Although electrons have electric charge 1, under the right conditions the elementary excitations in a solid have fractional charge 1/N (where N ∈2Z + 1). For example, this occurs in the fractional quantum Hall eﬀect.\n\n• Conﬁnement: The elementary excitations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are quarks. But they never appear on their own, only in groups of three (in a baryon) or with an anti-quark (in a meson). They are conﬁned.\n\n• Emergent Space: There are ﬁeld theories in four dimensions which at strong coupling become quantum gravity theories in ten dimensions! The strong coupling eﬀects cause the excitations to act as if they’re gravitons moving in higher dimensions. This is quite extraordinary and still poorly understood. It’s called the AdS/CFT correspondence. 3.1 The Interaction Picture There’s a useful viewpoint in quantum mechanics to describe situations where we have small perturbations to a well-understood Hamiltonian. Let’s return to the familiar ground of quantum mechanics with a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom for a moment. In the Schr¨odinger picture, the states evolve as id|ψ⟩S dt = H |ψ⟩S (3.8) while the operators OS are independent of time. In contrast, in the Heisenberg picture the states are ﬁxed and the operators change in time OH(t) = eiHtOS e−iHt\n\n|ψ⟩H = eiHt |ψ⟩S (3.9)\n\n– 50 – The interaction picture is a hybrid of the two. We split the Hamiltonian up as H = H0 + Hint (3.10) The time dependence of operators is governed by H0, while the time dependence of states is governed by Hint. Although the split into H0 and Hint is arbitrary, it’s useful when H0 is soluble (for example, when H0 is the Hamiltonian for a free ﬁeld theory). The states and operators in the interaction picture will be denoted by a subscript I and are given by,\n\n|ψ(t)⟩I = eiH0t |ψ(t)⟩S OI(t) = eiH0tOSe−iH0t (3.11) This last equation also applies to Hint, which is time dependent. The interaction Hamiltonian in the interaction picture is, HI ≡(Hint)I = eiH0t(Hint)S e−iH0t (3.12) The Schr¨odinger equation for states in the interaction picture can be derived starting from the Schr¨odinger picture id|ψ⟩S dt = HS |ψ⟩S ⇒ i d dt \u0000 e−iH0t |ψ⟩I \u0001 = (H0 + Hint)S e−iH0t |ψ⟩I\n\n⇒ id|ψ⟩I dt = eiH0t(Hint)S e−iH0t |ψ⟩I (3.13) So we learn that id|ψ⟩I dt = HI(t) |ψ⟩I (3.14) 3.1.1 Dyson’s Formula “Well, Birmingham has much the best theoretical physicist to work with, Peierls; Bristol has much the best experimental physicist, Powell; Cambridge has some excellent architecture. You can make your choice.” Oppenheimer’s advice to Dyson on which university position to accept. We want to solve (3.14). Let’s write the solution as\n\n|ψ(t)⟩I = U(t, t0) |ψ(t0)⟩I (3.15)\n\n– 51 – where U(t, t0) is a unitary time evolution operator such that U(t1, t2)U(t2, t3) = U(t1, t3) and U(t, t) = 1. Then the interaction picture Schr¨odinger equation (3.14) requires that idU dt = HI(t) U (3.16) If HI were a function, then we could simply solve this by U(t, t0) ?= exp \u0012 −i Z t t0 HI(t′) dt′ \u0013 (3.17) But there’s a problem. Our Hamiltonian HI is an operator, and we have ordering issues. Let’s see why this causes trouble. The exponential of an operator is deﬁned in terms of the expansion,\n\n\u0012Z t exp \u0012 −i Z t t0 HI(t′) dt′ \u0013 = 1 −i Z t t0 HI(t′) dt′ \u00132 + . . .(3.18) t0 HI(t′) dt′ + (−i)2 2 But when we try to diﬀerentiate this with respect to t, we ﬁnd that the quadratic term gives us\n\n\u0012Z t 2HI(t) \u0012Z t t0 HI(t′) dt′ \u0013 HI(t) −1 t0 HI(t′) dt′ \u0013 (3.19)\n\n−1 2 Now the second term here looks good, since it will give part of the HI(t)U that we need on the right-hand side of (3.16). But the ﬁrst term is no good since the HI(t) sits the wrong side of the integral term, and we can’t commute it through because [HI(t′), HI(t)] ̸= 0 when t′ ̸= t. So what’s the way around this?\n\nClaim: The solution to (3.16) is given by Dyson’s Formula. (Essentially ﬁrst ﬁgured out by Dirac, although the compact notation is due to Dyson). U(t, t0) = T exp \u0012 −i Z t t0 HI(t′) dt′ \u0013 (3.20) where T stands for time ordering where operators evaluated at later times are placed to the left ( O1(t1) O2(t2) t1 > t2 O2(t2) O1(t1) t2 > t1 (3.21) T (O1(t1) O2(t2)) = Expanding out the expression (3.20), we now have U(t, t0) = 1 −i Z t\n\n\u0014Z t t0 dt′ Z t t0 dt′ HI(t′) + (−i)2 t′ dt′′ HI(t′′)HI(t′) 2\n\n+ Z t t0 dt′ Z t′\n\n# t0 dt′′ HI(t′)HI(t′′)\n\n+ . . .\n\n– 52 – Actually these last two terms double up since Z t t0 dt′ Z t t′ dt′′ HI(t′′)HI(t′) = Z t t0 dt′′ Z t′′ t0 dt′ HI(t′′)HI(t′)\n\n= Z t t0 dt′ Z t′ t0 dt′′ HI(t′)HI(t′′) (3.22) where the range of integration in the ﬁrst expression is over t′′ ≥t′, while in the second expression it is t′ ≤t′′ which is, of course, the same thing. The ﬁnal expression is the same as the second expression by a simple relabelling. This means that we can write U(t, t0) = 1 −i Z t t0 dt′ HI(t′) + (−i)2 Z t t0 dt′ Z t′ t0 dt′′ HI(t′)HI(t′′) + . . . (3.23) Proof: The proof of Dyson’s formula is simpler than explaining what all the notation means! Firstly observe that under the T sign, all operators commute (since their order is already ﬁxed by the T sign). Thus\n\n∂t T exp \u0012 −i Z t t0 dt′ HI(t′) \u0013 = T \u0014 HI(t) exp \u0012 −i Z t t0 dt′ HI(t′) \u0013\u0015 i ∂\n\n= HI(t) T exp \u0012 −i Z t t0 dt′ HI(t′) \u0013 (3.24) since t, being the upper limit of the integral, is the latest time so HI(t) can be pulled out to the left. □ Before moving on, I should confess that Dyson’s formula is rather formal. It is typically very hard to compute time ordered exponentials in practice. The power of the formula comes from the expansion which is valid when HI is small and is very easily computed. 3.2 A First Look at Scattering Let us now apply the interaction picture to ﬁeld theory, starting with the interaction Hamiltonian for our scalar Yukawa theory, Hint = g Z d3x ψ†ψφ (3.25) Unlike the free theories discussed in Section 2, this interaction doesn’t conserve particle number, allowing particles of one type to morph into others. To see why this is, we use\n\n– 53 – the interaction picture and follow the evolution of the state: |ψ(t)⟩= U(t, t0) |ψ(t0)⟩, where U(t, t0) is given by Dyson’s formula (3.20) which is an expansion in powers of Hint. But Hint contains creation and annihilation operators for each type of particle. In particular,\n\n• φ ∼a + a†: This operator can create or destroy φ particles. Let’s call them mesons.\n\n• ψ ∼b + c†: This operator can destroy ψ particles through b, and create antiparticles through c†. Let’s call these particles nucleons. Of course, in reality nucleons are spin 1/2 particles, and don’t arise from the quantization of a scalar ﬁeld. But we’ll treat our scalar Yukawa theory as a toy model for nucleons interacting with mesons.\n\n• ψ† ∼b† + c: This operator can create nucleons through b†, and destroy antinucleons through c. Importantly, Q = Nc −Nb remains conserved in the presence of Hint. At ﬁrst order in perturbation theory, we ﬁnd terms in Hint like c†b†a. This kills a meson, producing a nucleon-anti-nucleon pair. It will contribute to meson decay φ →ψ ¯ψ. At second order in perturbation theory, we’ll have more complicated terms in (Hint)2, for example (c†b†a)(cba†). This term will give contributions to scattering processes ψ ¯ψ →φ →ψ ¯ψ. The rest of this section is devoted to computing the quantum amplitudes for these processes to occur. To calculate amplitudes we make an important, and slightly dodgy, assumption: Initial and ﬁnal states are eigenstates of the free theory This means that we take the initial state |i⟩at t →−∞, and the ﬁnal state |f⟩at t →+∞, to be eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian H0. At some level, this sounds plausible: at t →−∞, the particles in a scattering process are far separated and don’t feel the eﬀects of each other. Furthermore, we intuitively expect these states to be eigenstates of the individual number operators N, which commute with H0, but not Hint. As the particles approach each other, they interact brieﬂy, before departing again, each going on its own merry way. The amplitude to go from |i⟩to |f⟩is lim t±→±∞⟨f| U(t+, t−) |i⟩≡⟨f| S |i⟩ (3.26) where the unitary operator S is known as the S-matrix. (S is for scattering). There are a number of reasons why the assumption of non-interacting initial and ﬁnal states is shaky:\n\n– 54 –\n\n• Obviously we can’t cope with bound states. For example, this formalism can’t describe the scattering of an electron and proton which collide, bind, and leave as a Hydrogen atom. It’s possible to circumvent this objection since it turns out that bound states show up as poles in the S-matrix.\n\n• More importantly, a single particle, a long way from its neighbors, is never alone in ﬁeld theory. This is true even in classical electrodynamics, where the electron sources the electromagnetic ﬁeld from which it can never escape. In quantum electrodynamics (QED), a related fact is that there is a cloud of virtual photons surrounding the electron. This line of thought gets us into the issues of renormalization — more on this next term in the “AQFT” course. Nevertheless, motivated by this problem, after developing scattering theory using the assumption of noninteracting asymptotic states, we’ll mention a better way. 3.2.1 An Example: Meson Decay Consider the relativistically normalized initial and ﬁnal states, 2E⃗p a† ⃗p |0⟩\n\n|i⟩= p 4E⃗q1E⃗q2 b† ⃗q1 c† ⃗q2 |0⟩ (3.27)\n\n|f⟩= p The initial state contains a single meson of momentum p; the ﬁnal state contains a nucleon-anti-nucleon pair of momentum q1 and q2. We may compute the amplitude for the decay of a meson to a nucleon-anti-nucleon pair. To leading order in g, it is\n\n⟨f| S |i⟩= −ig ⟨f| Z d4x ψ†(x)ψ(x)φ(x) |i⟩ (3.28) Let’s go slowly. We ﬁrst expand out φ ∼a + a† using (2.84). (Remember that the φ in this formula is in the interaction picture, which is the same as the Heisenberg picture of the free theory). The a piece will turn |i⟩into something proportional to |0⟩, while the a† piece will turn |i⟩into a two meson state. But the two meson state will have zero overlap with ⟨f|, and there’s nothing in the ψ and ψ† operators that lie between them to change this fact. So we have p\n\n⟨f| S |i⟩= −ig ⟨f| Z d4x ψ†(x)ψ(x) Z d3k (2π)3 2E⃗p p2E⃗k a⃗k a† ⃗p e−ik·x |0⟩\n\n= −ig ⟨f| Z d4x ψ†(x)ψ(x)e−ip·x |0⟩ (3.29) where, in the second line, we’ve commuted a⃗k past a† ⃗p, picking up a δ(3)(⃗p −⃗k) deltafunction which kills the d3k integral. We now similarly expand out ψ ∼b + c† and\n\n– 55 –\n\nψ† ∼b† + c. To get non-zero overlap with ⟨f|, only the b† and c† contribute, for they create the nucleon and anti-nucleon from |0⟩. We then have\n\n⟨f| S |i⟩= −ig ⟨0| Z Z d4xd3k1d3k2 p E⃗q1E⃗q2 pE⃗k1E⃗k2 c⃗q2b⃗q1c† ⃗k1b† ⃗k2 |0⟩ei(k1+k2−p)·x (2π)6\n\n= −ig (2π)4 δ(4)(q1 + q2 −p) (3.30) and so we get our ﬁrst quantum ﬁeld theory amplitude. Notice that the δ-function puts constraints on the possible decays. In particular, the decay only happens at all if m ≥2M. To see this, we may always boost ourselves to a reference frame where the meson is stationary, so p = (m, 0, 0, 0). Then the delta function imposes momentum conservation, telling us that ⃗q1 = −⃗q2 and m = 2 p M 2 + |⃗q|2. Later you will learn how to turn this quantum amplitude into something more physical, namely the lifetime of the meson. The reason this is a little tricky is that we must square the amplitude to get the probability for decay, which means we get the square of a δ-function. We’ll explain how to deal with this in Section 3.6 below, and again in next term’s “Standard Model” course. 3.3 Wick’s Theorem From Dyson’s formula, we want to compute quantities like ⟨f| T {HI(x1) . . . HI(xn)} |i⟩, where |i⟩and |f⟩are eigenstates of the free theory. The ordering of the operators is ﬁxed by T, time ordering. However, since the HI’s contain certain creation and annihilation operators, our life will be much simpler if we can start to move all annihilation operators to the right where they can start killing things in |i⟩. Recall that this is the deﬁnition of normal ordering. Wick’s theorem tells us how to go from time ordered products to normal ordered products. 3.3.1 An Example: Recovering the Propagator Let’s start simple. Consider a real scalar ﬁeld which we decompose in the Heisenberg picture as\n\nφ(x) = φ+(x) + φ−(x) (3.31) where\n\nφ+(x) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p 2E⃗p a⃗p e−ip·x\n\nφ−(x) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p 2E⃗p a† ⃗p e+ip·x (3.32)\n\n– 56 – where the ± signs on φ± make little sense, but apparently you have Pauli and Heisenberg to blame. (They come about because φ+ ∼e−iEt, which is sometimes called the positive frequency piece, while φ−∼e+iEt is the negative frequency piece). Then choosing x0 > y0, we have T φ(x)φ(y) = φ(x)φ(y)\n\n= (φ+(x) + φ−(x))(φ+(y) + φ−(y)) (3.33)\n\n= φ+(x)φ+(y) + φ−(x)φ+(y) + φ−(y)φ+(x) + [φ+(x), φ−(y)] + φ−(x)φ−(y) where the last line is normal ordered, and for our troubles we have picked up the extra term D(x−y) = [φ+(x), φ−(y)] which is the propagator we met in (2.90). So for x0 > y0 we have T φ(x)φ(y) =: φ(x)φ(y) : + D(x −y) (3.34) Meanwhile, for y0 > x0, we may repeat the calculation to ﬁnd T φ(x)φ(y) =: φ(x)φ(y) : + D(y −x) (3.35) So putting this together, we have the ﬁnal expression T φ(x)φ(y) =: φ(x)φ(y) : + ∆F(x −y) (3.36) where ∆F(x −y) is the Feynman propagator deﬁned in (2.93), for which we have the integral representation\n\n∆F(x −y) = Z d4k (2π)4 ieik·(x−y) k2 −m2 + iϵ (3.37) Let me reiterate a comment from Section 2: although T φ(x)φ(y) and : φ(x)φ(y) : are both operators, the diﬀerence between them is a c-number function, ∆F(x −y). Deﬁnition: We deﬁne the contraction of a pair of ﬁelds in a string of operators . . . φ(x1) . . . φ(x2) . . . to mean replacing those operators with the Feynman propagator, leaving all other operators untouched. We use the notation,\n\n. . . z }| { φ(x1) . . . φ(x2) . . . (3.38) to denote contraction. So, for example, z }| { φ(x)φ(y) = ∆F(x −y) (3.39)\n\n– 57 – A similar discussion holds for complex scalar ﬁelds. We have Tψ(x)ψ†(y) =: ψ(x)ψ†(y) : +∆F(x −y) (3.40) prompting us to deﬁne the contraction z }| { ψ(x)ψ†(y) = ∆F(x −y) and z }| { ψ(x)ψ(y) = z }| { ψ†(x)ψ†(y) = 0 (3.41) 3.3.2 Wick’s Theorem For any collection of ﬁelds φ1 = φ(x1), φ2 = φ(x2), etc, we have T(φ1 . . . φn) =: φ1 . . . φn : + : all possible contractions : (3.42) To see what the last part of this equation means, let’s look at an example. For n = 4, the equation reads T(φ1φ2φ3φ4) = : φ1φ2φ3φ4 : + z}|{ φ1φ2 : φ3φ4 : + z}|{ φ1φ3 : φ2φ4 : + four similar terms\n\n+ z}|{ φ1φ2 z}|{ φ3φ4 + z}|{ φ1φ3 z}|{ φ2φ4 + z}|{ φ1φ4 z}|{ φ2φ3 (3.43) Proof: The proof of Wick’s theorem proceeds by induction and a little thought. It’s true for n = 2. Suppose it’s true for φ2 . . . φn and now add φ1. We’ll take x0 1 > x0 k for all k = 2, . . . , n. Then we can pull φ1 out to the left of the time ordered product, writing T (φ1φ2 . . . φn) = (φ+ 1 + φ− 1 ) (: φ2 . . . φn : + : contractions :) (3.44) The φ− 1 term stays where it is since it is already normal ordered. But in order to write the right-hand side as a normal ordered product, the φ+ 1 term has to make its way past the crowd of φ− k operators. Each time it moves past φ− k , we pick up a factor of z}|{ φ1φk = ∆F(x1 −xk) from the commutator. (Try it!) □ 3.3.3 An Example: Nucleon Scattering Let’s look at ψψ →ψψ scattering. We have the initial and ﬁnal states 2E⃗p2 b† ⃗p1 b† ⃗p2 |0⟩≡|p1, p2⟩ 2E⃗p1 p\n\n|i⟩= p\n\n|f⟩= q 2E⃗p′ 1 q 2E⃗p ′ 2 b† ⃗p ′ 1b† ⃗p ′ 2 |0⟩≡|p ′ 1, p ′ 2⟩ (3.45) We can then look at the expansion of ⟨f| S |i⟩. In fact, we really want to calculate ⟨f| S −1 |i⟩since we’re not interested in situations where no scattering occurs. At order g2 we have the term (−ig)2 Z d4x1d4x2 T \u0000 ψ†(x1)ψ(x1)φ(x1)ψ†(x2)ψ(x2)φ(x2) \u0001 (3.46) 2\n\n– 58 – Now, using Wick’s theorem we see there is a piece in the string of operators which looks like\n\n: ψ†(x1)ψ(x1)ψ†(x2)ψ(x2) : z }| { φ(x1)φ(x2) (3.47) which will contribute to the scattering because the two ψ ﬁelds annihilate the ψ particles, while the two ψ† ﬁelds create ψ particles. Any other way of ordering the ψ and ψ† ﬁelds will give zero contribution. This means that we have\n\n⟨p′ 1, p′ 2| : ψ†(x1)ψ(x1)ψ†(x2)ψ(x2) : |p1, p2⟩\n\n= ⟨p′ 1, p′ 2| ψ†(x1)ψ†(x2) |0⟩⟨0| ψ(x1)ψ(x2) |p1, p2⟩\n\n= \u0010 eip′ 1·x1+ip′ 2·x2 + eip′ 1·x2+ip′ 2·x1\u0011 \u0000 e−ip1·x1−ip2·x2 + e−ip1·x2−ip2·x1\u0001\n\n= eix1·(p′ 1−p1)+ix2·(p′ 2−p2) + eix1·(p′ 2−p1)+ix2·(p′ 1−p2) + (x1 ↔x2) (3.48) where, in going to the third line, we’ve used the fact that for relativistically normalized states,\n\n⟨0| ψ(x) |p⟩= e−ip·x (3.49) Now let’s insert this into (3.46), to get the expression for ⟨f| S |i⟩at order g2, Z d4x1d4x2 \u0002 ei... + ei... + (x1 ↔x2) \u0003 Z d4k (2π)4 ieik·(x1−x2) (−ig)2 k2 −m2 + iϵ (3.50) 2 where the expression in square brackets is (3.48), while the ﬁnal integral is the φ propagator which comes from the contraction in (3.47). Now the (x1 ↔x2) terms double up with the others to cancel the factor of 1/2 out front. Meanwhile, the x1 and x2 integrals give delta-functions. We’re left with the expression (−ig)2 Z d4k (2π)4 i(2π)8 k2 −m2 + iϵ \u0002 δ(4)(p′ 1 −p1 + k) δ(4)(p′ 2 −p2 −k)\n\n+ δ(4)(p′ 2 −p1 + k) δ(4)(p′ 1 −p2 −k) \u0003 (3.51) Finally, we can trivially do the d4k integral using the delta-functions to get\n\n\u0015 (2π)4 δ(4)(p1 + p2 −p′ 1 −p′ 2) i(−ig)2 \u0014 1 (p1 −p ′ 1)2 −m2 + iϵ + 1 (p1 −p ′ 2)2 −m2 + iϵ In fact, for this process we may drop the +iϵ terms since the denominator is never zero. To see this, we can go to the center of mass frame, where ⃗p1 = −⃗p2 and, by\n\n– 59 – momentum conservation, |⃗p1| = |⃗p ′ 1 |. This ensures that the 4-momentum of the meson is k = (0, ⃗p −⃗p ′), so k2 < 0. We therefore have the end result, i(−ig)2 \u0014 1 (p1 −p ′ 1)2 −m2 + 1 (p1 −p ′ 2)2 −m2\n\n\u0015 (2π)4 δ(4)(p1 + p2 −p′ 1 −p′ 2) (3.52) We will see another, much simpler way to reproduce this result shortly using Feynman diagrams. This will also shed light on the physical interpretation. This calculation is also relevant for other scattering processes, such as ¯ψ ¯ψ →¯ψ ¯ψ, ψ ¯ψ →ψ ¯ψ. Each of these comes from the term (3.48) in Wick’s theorem. However, we will never ﬁnd a term that contributes to scattering ψψ →¯ψ ¯ψ, for this would violate the conservation of Q charge. Another Example: Meson-Nucleon Scattering If we want to compute ψφ →ψφ scattering at order g2, we would need to pick out the term\n\n: ψ†(x1)φ(x1)ψ(x2)φ(x2) : z }| { ψ(x1)ψ†(x2) (3.53) and a similar term with ψ and ψ† exchanged. Once more, this term also contributes to similar scattering processes, including ¯ψφ →¯ψφ and φφ →ψ ¯ψ. 3.4 Feynman Diagrams “Like the silicon chips of more recent years, the Feynman diagram was bringing computation to the masses.” Julian Schwinger As the above example demonstrates, to actually compute scattering amplitudes using Wick’s theorem is rather tedious. There’s a much better way. It requires drawing pretty pictures. These pictures represent the expansion of ⟨f| S |i⟩and we will learn how to associate numbers (or at least integrals) to them. These pictures are called Feynman diagrams. The object that we really want to compute is ⟨f| S−1 |i⟩, since we’re not interested in processes where no scattering occurs. The various terms in the perturbative expansion can be represented pictorially as follows\n\n• Draw an external line for each particle in the initial state |i⟩and each particle in the ﬁnal state |f⟩. We’ll choose dotted lines for mesons, and solid lines for nucleons. Assign a directed momentum p to each line. Further, add an arrow to\n\n– 60 – solid lines to denote its charge; we’ll choose an incoming (outgoing) arrow in the initial state for ψ ( ¯ψ). We choose the reverse convention for the ﬁnal state, where an outgoing arrow denotes ψ.\n\nψ\n\n• Join the external lines together with trivalent vertices\n\nφ\n\nψ+ Each such diagram you can draw is in 1-1 correspondence with the terms in the expansion of ⟨f| S −1 |i⟩. 3.4.1 Feynman Rules To each diagram we associate a number, using the Feynman rules\n\n• Add a momentum k to each internal line\n\n• To each vertex, write down a factor of (−ig) (2π)4 δ(4)( X i ki) (3.54) where P ki is the sum of all momenta ﬂowing into the vertex.\n\n• For each internal dotted line, corresponding to a φ particle with momentum k, we write down a factor of Z d4k (2π)4 i k2 −m2 + iϵ (3.55) We include the same factor for solid internal ψ lines, with m replaced by the nucleon mass M.\n\n– 61 – 3.5 Examples of Scattering Amplitudes Let’s apply the Feynman rules to compute the amplitudes for various processes. We start with something familiar: Nucleon Scattering Revisited Let’s look at how this works for the ψψ →ψψ scattering at order g2. We can write down the two simplest diagrams contributing to this process. They are shown in Figure 9. p1 p1 / p1 / p 2 k k\n\n+\n\n/ p / p2 1 p2 p2 Figure 9: The two lowest order Feynman diagrams for nucleon scattering. Applying the Feynman rules to these diagrams, we get i(−ig)2 \u0014 1 (p1 −p ′ 1)2 −m2 + 1 (p1 −p ′ 2)2 −m2\n\n\u0015 (2π)4 δ(4)(p1 + p2 −p′ 1 −p′ 2) (3.56) which agrees with the calculation (3.51) that we performed earlier. There is a nice physical interpretation of these diagrams. We talk, rather loosely, of the nucleons exchanging a meson which, in the ﬁrst diagram, has momentum k = (p1−p′ 1) = (p′ 2−p2). This meson doesn’t satisfy the usual energy dispersion relation, because k2 ̸= m2: the meson is called a virtual particle and is said to be oﬀ-shell (or, sometimes, oﬀmassshell). Heuristically, it can’t live long enough for its energy to be measured to great accuracy. In contrast, the momentum on the external, nucleon legs all satisfy p2 = M 2, the mass of the nucleon. They are on-shell. One ﬁnal note: the addition of the two diagrams above ensures that the particles satisfy Bose statistics. There are also more complicated diagrams which will contribute to the scattering process at higher orders. For example, we have the two diagrams shown in Figures 10 and 11, and similar diagrams with p′ 1 and p′ 2 exchanged. Using the Feynman rules, each of these diagrams translates into an integral that we will not attempt to calculate here. And so we go on, with increasingly complicated diagrams, all appearing at higher order in the coupling constant g.\n\n– 62 – p1 p1 p1 / p1 /\n\n/\n\n/ p2 p2 p2 p2 Figure 10: A contribution at O(g4). Figure 11: A contribution at O(g6) Amplitudes Our ﬁnal result for the nucleon scattering amplitude ⟨f| S −1 |i⟩at order g2 was i(−ig)2 \u0014 1 (p1 −p ′ 1)2 −m2 + 1 (p1 −p ′ 2)2 −m2\n\n\u0015 (2π)4 δ(4)(p1 + p2 −p ′ 1 −p ′ 2) The δ-function follows from the conservation of 4-momentum which, in turn, follows from spacetime translational invariance. It is common to all S-matrix elements. We will deﬁne the amplitude Afi by stripping oﬀthis momentum-conserving delta-function,\n\n⟨f| S −1 |i⟩= i Afi (2π)4δ(4)(pF −pI) (3.57) where pI (pF) is the sum of the initial (ﬁnal) 4-momenta, and the factor of i out front is a convention which is there to match non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We can now reﬁne our Feynman rules to compute the amplitude iAfi itself:\n\n• Draw all possible diagrams with appropriate external legs and impose 4-momentum conservation at each vertex.\n\n• Write down a factor of (−ig) at each vertex.\n\n• For each internal line, write down the propagator\n\n• Integrate over momentum k ﬂowing through each loop R d4k/(2π)4. This last step deserves a short explanation. The diagrams we’ve computed so far have no loops. They are tree level diagrams. It’s not hard to convince yourself that in tree diagrams, momentum conservation at each vertex is suﬃcient to determine the momentum ﬂowing through each internal line. For diagrams with loops, such as those shown in Figures 10 and 11, this is no longer the case.\n\n– 63 – p1 p1 p1 / p / 2\n\n+ p /\n\n/ p2 1 p2 p2 Figure 12: The two lowest order Feynman diagrams for nucleon to meson scattering. Nucleon to Meson Scattering Let’s now look at the amplitude for a nucleon-anti-nucleon pair to annihilate into a pair of mesons: ψ ¯ψ →φφ. The simplest Feynman diagrams for this process are shown in Figure 12 where the virtual particle in these diagrams is now the nucleon ψ rather than the meson φ. This fact is reﬂected in the denominator of the amplitudes which are given by iA = (−ig)2 \u0014 i (p1 −p ′ 1)2 −M 2 + i (p1 −p ′ 2)2 −M 2\n\n\u0015 (3.58) As in (3.52), we’ve dropped the iϵ from the propagators as the denominator never vanishes. Nucleon-Anti-Nucleon Scattering p1 p1 / p1 p1 /\n\n/ + p2\n\n/ p2 p2 p2 Figure 13: The two lowest order Feynman diagrams for nucleon-anti-nucleon scattering. For the scattering of a nucleon and an anti-nucleon, ψ ¯ψ →ψ ¯ψ, the Feynman diagrams are a little diﬀerent. At lowest order, they are given by the diagrams of Figure 13. It is a simple matter to write down the amplitude using the Feynman rules, iA = (−ig)2 \u0014 i (p1 −p ′ 1)2 −m2 + i (p1 + p2)2 −m2 + iϵ\n\n\u0015 (3.59)\n\n– 64 – Notice that the momentum dependence in the second term is diﬀerent from that of nucleon-nucleon scattering (3.56), reﬂecting the diﬀerent Feynman diagram that contributes to the process. In the center of mass frame, ⃗p1 = −⃗p2, the denominator of the second term is 4(M 2 + ⃗p 2 1 ) −m2. If m < 2M, then this term never vanishes and we may drop the iϵ. In contrast, if m > 2M, then the amplitude corresponding to the second diagram diverges at some value of ⃗p. In this case it turns out that we may also neglect the iϵ term, although for a diﬀerent reason: the meson is unstable when m > 2M, a result we derived in (3.30). When correctly treated, this instability adds a ﬁnite imaginary piece to the denominator which overwhelms the iϵ. Nonetheless, the increase in the scattering amplitude which we see in the second diagram when 4(M 2 + ⃗p 2) = m2 is what allows us to discover new particles: they appear as a resonance in the cross section. For example, the Figure 14 shows the cross-section (roughly the amplitude squared) plotted vertically for e+e−→µ+µ− Figure 14: scattering from the ALEPH experiment in CERN. The horizontal axis shows the center of mass energy. The curve rises sharply around 91 GeV, the mass of the Z-boson. Meson Scattering For φφ →φφ, the simplest diagram we can write p1 / k+ down has a single loop, and momentum conservation at each vertex is no longer suﬃcient to determine every momentum passing through the diagram. We choose to assign the single undetermined momentum k to the right-hand propagator. All other momenta are then determined. The amplitude corresponding to the diagram shown in the ﬁgure is 1p p1 / p1 / 1p k\n\n− + k p / 2 p2 p / 2\n\n− k Figure 15: (−ig)4 Z d4k (2π)4 1 (k2 −M 2 + iϵ)((k + p′ 1)2 −M 2 + iϵ)\n\n× 1 ((k + p ′ 1 −p1)2 −M 2 + iϵ)((k −p ′ 2)2 −M 2 + iϵ) These integrals can be tricky. For large k, this integral goes as R d4k/k8, which is at least convergent as k →∞. But this won’t always be the case!\n\n– 65 – 3.5.1 Mandelstam Variables We see that in many of the amplitudes above — in particular those that include the exchange of just a single particle — the same combinations of momenta are appearing frequently in the denominators. There are standard names for various sums and diﬀerences of momenta: they are known as Mandelstam variables. They are s = (p1 + p2)2 = (p′ 1 + p′ 2)2 t = (p1 −p′ 1)2 = (p2 −p′ 2)2 (3.60) u = (p1 −p′ 2)2 = (p2 −p′ 1)2 where, as in the examples above, p1 and p2 are the momenta of the two initial particles, and p′ 1 and p′ 2 are the momenta of the ﬁnal two particles. We can deﬁne these variables whether the particles involved in the scattering are the same or diﬀerent. To get a feel for what these variables mean, let’s assume all four particles are the same. We sit in the center of mass frame, so that the initial two particles have four-momenta p1 = (E, 0, 0, p) and p2 = (E, 0, 0, −p) (3.61) The particles then scatter at some angle θ and leave with momenta p′ 1 = (E, 0, p sin θ, p cos θ) and p′ 2 = (E, 0, −p sin θ, −p cos θ) (3.62) Then from the above deﬁnitions, we have that s = 4E2 and t = −2p2(1 −cos θ) and u = −2p2(1 + cos θ) (3.63) The variable s measures the total center of mass energy of the collision, while the variables t and u are measures of the momentum exchanged between particles. (They are basically equivalent, just with the outgoing particles swapped around). Now the amplitudes that involve exchange of a single particle can be written simply in terms of the Mandelstam variables. For example, for nucleon-nucleon scattering, the amplitude (3.56) is schematically A ∼(t −m2)−1 + (u −m2)−1. For the nucleon-anti-nucleon scattering, the amplitude (3.59) is A ∼(t −m2)−1 + (s −m2)−1. We say that the ﬁrst case involves “t-channel” and “u-channel” diagrams. Meanwhile the nucleon-antinucleon scattering is said to involve “t-channel” and “s-channel” diagrams. (The ﬁrst diagram indeed includes a vertex that looks like the letter “T”). Note that there is a relationship between the Mandelstam variables. When all the masses are the same we have s+t+u = 4M 2. When the masses of all 4 particles diﬀer, this becomes s + t + u = P i M 2 i .\n\n– 66 – 3.5.2 The Yukawa Potential So far we’ve computed the quantum amplitudes for various scattering processes. But these quantities are a little abstract. In Section 3.6 below (and again in next term’s “Standard Model” course) we’ll see how to turn amplitudes into measurable quantities such as cross-sections, or the lifetimes of unstable particles. Here we’ll instead show how to translate the amplitude (3.52) for nucleon scattering into something familiar from Newtonian mechanics: a potential, or force, between the particles. Let’s start by asking a simple question in classical ﬁeld theory that will turn out to be relevant. Suppose that we have a ﬁxed δ-function source for a real scalar ﬁeld φ, that persists for all time. What is the proﬁle of φ(⃗x)? To answer this, we must solve the static Klein-Gordon equation,\n\n−∇2φ + m2φ = δ(3)(⃗x) (3.64) We can solve this using the Fourier transform,\n\nφ(⃗x) = Z d3k (2π)3 ei⃗k·⃗x ˜φ(⃗k) (3.65) Plugging this into (3.64) tells us that (⃗k 2 + m2)˜φ(⃗k) = 1, giving us the solution\n\nφ(⃗x) = Z d3k (2π)3 ei⃗k·⃗x\n\n⃗k 2 + m2 (3.66) Let’s now do this integral. Changing to polar coordinates, and writing ⃗k · ⃗x = kr cos θ, we have Z ∞ 0 dk k2\n\nφ(⃗x) = 1 (2π)2 k2 + m2 2 sin kr kr Z +∞\n\n= 1 (2π)2r\n\n−∞ dk k sin kr k2 + m2\n\n= 1 2πrRe \u0014Z +∞ dk 2πi keikr\n\n\u0015 (3.67) k2 + m2\n\n−∞ We compute this last integral by closing the contour in the upper half plane k →+i∞, picking up the pole at k = +im. This gives\n\nφ(⃗x) = 1 4πr e−mr (3.68) The ﬁeld dies oﬀexponentially quickly at distances 1/m, the Compton wavelength of the meson.\n\n– 67 – Now we understand the proﬁle of the φ ﬁeld, what does this have to do with the force between ψ particles? We do very similar calculations to that above in electrostatics where a charged particle acts as a δ-function source for the gauge potential: −∇2A0 = δ(3)(⃗x), which is solved by A0 = 1/4πr. The proﬁle for A0 then acts as the potential energy for another charged (test) particle moving in this background. Can we give the same interpretation to our scalar ﬁeld? In other words, is there a classical limit of the scalar Yukawa theory where the ψ particles act as δ-function sources for φ, creating the proﬁle (3.68)? And, if so, is this proﬁle then felt as a static potential? The answer is essentially yes, at least in the limit M ≫m. But the correct way to describe the potential felt by the ψ particles is not to talk about classical ﬁelds at all, but instead work directly with the quantum amplitudes. Our strategy is to compare the nucleon scattering amplitude (3.52) to the corresponding amplitude in non-relativistic quantum mechanics for two particles interacting through a potential. To make this comparison, we should ﬁrst take the non-relativistic limit of (3.52). Let’s work in the center of mass frame, with ⃗p ≡⃗p1 = −⃗p2 and ⃗p ′ ≡⃗p ′ 1 = −⃗p ′ 2 . The non-relativistic limit means |⃗p| ≪M which, by momentum conservation, ensures that |⃗p ′| ≪M. In fact one can check that, for this particular example, this limit doesn’t change the scattering amplitude (3.52): it’s given by iA = +ig2 \u0014 1 (⃗p −⃗p ′)2 + m2 + 1 (⃗p + ⃗p ′)2 + m2\n\n\u0015 (3.69) How do we compare this to scattering in quantum mechanics? Consider two particles, separated by a distance ⃗r, interacting through a potential U(⃗r). In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the amplitude for the particles to scatter from momentum states ±⃗p into momentum states ±⃗p ′ can be computed in perturbation theory, using the techniques described in Section 3.1. To leading order, known in this context as the Born approximation, the amplitude is given by\n\n⟨⃗p ′| U(⃗r) |⃗p ⟩= −i Z d3r U(⃗r)e−i(⃗p−⃗p′)·⃗r (3.70) There’s a relative factor of (2M)2 that arises in comparing the quantum ﬁeld theory amplitude A to ⟨⃗p ′| U(⃗r) |⃗p⟩, that can be traced to the relativistic normalization of the states |p1, p2⟩. (It is also necessary to get the dimensions of the potential to work out correctly). Including this factor, and equating the expressions for the two amplitudes, we get Z d3r U(⃗r) e−i(⃗p−⃗p′)·⃗r = −λ2 (⃗p −⃗p ′)2 + m2 (3.71)\n\n– 68 – where we’ve introduced the dimensionless parameter λ = g/2M. We can trivially invert this to ﬁnd, U(⃗r) = −λ2 Z d3p (2π)3 ei⃗p·⃗r\n\n⃗p 2 + m2 (3.72) But this is exactly the integral (3.66) we just did in the classical theory. We have U(⃗r) = −λ2 4πr e−mr (3.73) This is the Yukawa potential. The force has a range 1/m, the Compton wavelength of the exchanged particle. The minus sign tells us that the potential is attractive. Notice that quantum ﬁeld theory has given us an entirely new perspective on the nature of forces between particles. Rather than being a fundamental concept, the force arises from the virtual exchange of other particles, in this case the meson. In Section 6 of these lectures, we will see how the Coulomb force arises from quantum ﬁeld theory due to the exchange of virtual photons. We could repeat the calculation for nucleon-anti-nucleon scattering. The amplitude from ﬁeld theory is given in (3.59). The ﬁrst term in this expression gives the same result as for nucleon-nucleon scattering with the same sign. The second term vanishes in the non-relativisitic limit (it is an example of an interaction that doesn’t have a simple Newtonian interpretation). There is no longer a factor of 1/2 in (3.70), because the incoming/outgoing particles are not identical, so we learn that the potential between a nucleon and anti-nucleon is again given by (3.73). This reveals a key feature of forces arising due to the exchange of scalars: they are universally attractive. Notice that this is diﬀerent from forces due to the exchange of a spin 1 particle — such as electromagnetism — where the sign ﬂips when we change the charge. However, for forces due to the exchange of a spin 2 particle — i.e. gravity — the force is again universally attractive. 3.5.3 φ4 Theory Let’s brieﬂy look at the Feynman rules and scattering amplitudes for the interaction Hamiltonian Hint = λ 4! φ4 (3.74) The theory now has a single interaction vertex, which comes with a factor of (−iλ), while the other Feynman rules remain the same. Note that we assign (−iλ) to the\n\n– 69 – vertex rather than (−iλ/4!). To see why this is, we can look at φφ →φφ scattering, which has its lowest contribution at order λ, with the term\n\n−iλ 4! ⟨p ′ 1, p ′ 2| : φ(x)φ(x)φ(x)φ(x) : |p1, p2⟩ (3.75) Any one of the ﬁelds can do the job of annihilation or creation. This gives 4! diﬀerent contractions, which cancels the 1/4! sitting out front. Feynman diagrams in the φ4 theory sometimes come with extra combinatoric factors (typically 2 or 4) which are known as symmetry factors that one must take into account. For more details, see the book by Peskin and Schroeder.\n\n−iλ Using the Feynman rules, the scattering amplitude for φφ →φφ is simply iA = −iλ. Note that it doesn’t depend on the angle at which the outgoing particles emerge: in φ4 theory the leading order two-particle scattering occurs with equal probability in all directions. Translating this into a potential between two mesons, we have Figure 16: Z d3p (2π)3 e+i⃗p·⃗r = λ (2m)2δ(3)(⃗r) (3.76) U(⃗r) = λ (2m)2 So scattering in φ4 theory is due to a δ-function potential. The particles don’t know what hit them until it’s over. 3.5.4 Connected Diagrams and Amputated Diagrams We’ve seen how one can compute scattering amplitudes by writing down all Feynman diagrams and assigning integrals to them using the Feynman rules. In fact, there are a couple of caveats about what Feynman diagrams you should write down. Both of these caveats are related to the assumption we made earlier that “initial and ﬁnal states are eigenstates of the free theory” which, as we mentioned at the time, is not strictly accurate. The two caveats which go some way towards ameliorating the problem are the following\n\n• We consider only connected Feynman diagrams, where every part of the diagram is connected to at least one external line. As we shall see shortly, this will be related to the fact that the vacuum |0⟩of the free theory is not the true vacuum |Ω⟩of the interacting theory. An example of a diagram that is not connected is shown in Figure 17.\n\n– 70 –\n\n• We do not consider diagrams with loops on external lines, for example the diagram shown in the Figure 18. We will not explain how to take these into account in this course, but you will discuss them next term. They are related to the fact that the one-particle states of the free theory are not the same as the one-particle states of the interacting theory. In particular, correctly dealing with these diagrams will account for the fact that particles in interacting quantum ﬁeld theories are never alone, but surrounded by a cloud of virtual particles. We will refer to diagrams in which all loops on external legs have been cut-oﬀas “amputated”. Figure 17: A disconnected diagram. Figure 18: An un-amputated diagram 3.6 What We Measure: Cross Sections and Decay Rates So far we’ve learnt to compute the quantum amplitudes for particles decaying or scattering. As usual in quantum theory, the probabilities for things to happen are the (modulus) square of the quantum amplitudes. In this section we will compute these probabilities, known as decay rates and cross sections. One small subtlety here is that the S-matrix elements ⟨f| S −1 |i⟩all come with a factor of (2π)4δ(4)(pF −pI), so we end up with the square of a delta-function. As we will now see, this comes from the fact that we’re working in an inﬁnite space. 3.6.1 Fermi’s Golden Rule Let’s start with something familiar and recall how to derive Fermi’s golden rule from Dyson’s formula. For two energy eigenstates |m⟩and |n⟩, with Em ̸= En, we have to leading order in the interaction,\n\n⟨m| U(t) |n⟩= −i ⟨m| Z t 0 dt HI(t) |n⟩\n\n= −i ⟨m| Hint |n⟩ Z t 0 dt′ eiωt′\n\n= −⟨m| Hint |n⟩eiωt −1\n\nω (3.77)\n\n– 71 – where ω = Em −En. This gives us the probability for the transition from |n⟩to |m⟩in time t, as Pn→m(t) = | ⟨m| U(t) |n⟩| 2 = 2| ⟨m| Hint |n⟩| 2 \u00121 −cos ωt\n\n\u0013 (3.78)\n\nω2 The function in brackets is plotted in Figure 19 for ﬁxed t. We see that in time t, most transitions happen in a region between energy eigenstates separated by ∆E = 2π/t. As t →∞, the function in the ﬁgure starts to approach a deltafunction. To ﬁnd the normalization, we can calculate Z +∞\n\n−∞ dω \u00121 −cos ωt\n\n\u0013 = πt\n\nω2\n\n\u0013 →πtδ(ω) as t →∞\n\n⇒ \u00121 −cos ωt Figure 19:\n\nω2 Consider now a transition to a cluster of states with density ρ(E). In the limit t →∞, we get the transition probability Pn→m = Z dEm ρ(Em) 2| ⟨m| Hint |n⟩| 2 \u00121 −cos ωt\n\n\u0013\n\nω2\n\n→2π | ⟨m| Hint |n⟩| 2 ρ(En)t (3.79) which gives a constant probability for the transition per unit time for states around the same energy En ∼Em = E.\n\n˙Pn→m = 2π| ⟨m| Hint |n⟩|2 ρ(E) (3.80) This is Fermi’s Golden Rule. In the above derivation, we were fairly careful with taking the limit as t →∞. Suppose we were a little sloppier, and ﬁrst chose to compute the amplitude for the state |n⟩at t →−∞to transition to the state |m⟩at t →+∞. Then we get\n\n−i ⟨m| Z t=+∞ t=−∞ HI(t) |n⟩= −i ⟨m| Hint |n⟩2πδ(ω) (3.81) Now when squaring the amplitude to get the probability, we run into the problem of the square of the delta-function: Pn→m = | ⟨m| Hint |n⟩|2(2π)2δ(ω)2. Tracking through the previous computations, we realize that the extra inﬁnity is coming because Pm→n\n\n– 72 – is the probability for the transition to happen in inﬁnite time t →∞. We can write the delta-functions as (2π)2δ(ω)2 = (2π)δ(ω) T (3.82) where T is shorthand for t →∞(we used a very similar trick when looking at the vacuum energy in (2.25)). We now divide out by this power of T to get the transition probability per unit time,\n\n˙Pn→m = 2π| ⟨m| Hint |n⟩|2 δ(ω) (3.83) which, after integrating over the density of ﬁnal states, gives us back Fermi’s Golden rule. The reason that we’ve stressed this point is because, in our ﬁeld theory calculations, we’ve computed the amplitudes in the same way as (3.81), and the square of the δ(4)-functions will just be re-interpreted as spacetime volume factors. 3.6.2 Decay Rates Let’s now look at the probability for a single particle |i⟩of momentum pI (I=initial) to decay into some number of particles |f⟩with momentum pi and total momentum pF = P i pi. This is given by P = | ⟨f| S |i⟩|2\n\n⟨f| f⟩⟨i| i⟩ (3.84) Our states obey the relativistic normalization formula (2.65),\n\n⟨i| i⟩= (2π)3 2E⃗pI δ(3)(0) = 2E ⃗pIV (3.85) where we have replaced δ(3)(0) by the volume of 3-space. Similarly,\n\n⟨f| f⟩= Y\n\nﬁnal states 2E⃗piV (3.86) If we place our initial particle at rest, so ⃗pI = 0 and E⃗pI = m, we get the probability for decay P = |Afi|2 1 2E⃗piV (3.87) 2mV (2π)4δ(4)(pI −pF) V T Y\n\nﬁnal states where, as in the second derivation of Fermi’s Golden Rule, we’ve exchanged one of the delta-functions for the volume of spacetime: (2π)4δ(4)(0) = V T. The amplitudes Afi are, of course, exactly what we’ve been computing. (For example, in (3.30), we saw\n\n– 73 – that A = −g for a single meson decaying into two nucleons). We can now divide out by T to get the transition function per unit time. But we still have to worry about summing over all ﬁnal states. There are two steps: the ﬁrst is to integrate over all possible momenta of the ﬁnal particles: V R d3pi/(2π)3. The factors of spatial volume V in this measure cancel those in (3.87), while the factors of 1/2E⃗pi in (3.87) conspire to produce the Lorentz invariant measure for 3-momentum integrals. The result is an expression for the density of ﬁnal states given by the Lorentz invariant measure d3pi (2π)3 1 2E⃗pi (3.88) dΠ = (2π)4δ(4)(pF −pI) Y\n\nﬁnal states The second step is to sum over all ﬁnal states with diﬀerent numbers (and possibly types) of particles. This gives us our ﬁnal expression for the decay probability per unit time, Γ = ˙P.\n\nΓ = 1 2m Z |Afi|2 dΠ (3.89) X\n\nﬁnal states\n\nΓ is called the width of the particle. It is equal to the reciprocal of the half-life τ = 1/Γ. 3.6.3 Cross Sections Collide two beams of particles. Sometimes the particles will hit and bounce oﬀeach other; sometimes they will pass right through. The fraction of the time that they collide is called the cross section and is denoted by σ. If the incoming ﬂux F is deﬁned to be the number of incoming particles per area per unit time, then the total number of scattering events N per unit time is given by, N = Fσ (3.90) We would like to calculate σ from quantum ﬁeld theory. In fact, we can calculate a more sensitive quantity dσ known as the diﬀerential cross section which is the probability for a given scattering process to occur in the solid angle (θ, φ). More precisely Unit Time × Unit Flux = 1 4E1E2V 1 F |Afi|2 dΠ (3.91) dσ = Diﬀerential Probability where we’ve used the expression for probability per unit time that we computed in the previous subsection. E1 and E2 are the energies of the incoming particles. We now need an expression for the unit ﬂux. For simplicity, let’s sit in the center of mass frame of the collision. We’ve been considering just a single particle per spatial volume V ,\n\n– 74 – meaning that the ﬂux is given in terms of the 3-velocities ⃗vi as F = |⃗v1 −⃗v2|/V . This then gives, dσ = 1 4E1E2 1 |⃗v1 −⃗v2||Afi|2 dΠ (3.92) If you want to write this in terms of momentum, then recall from your course on special relativity that the 3-velocities ⃗vi are related to the momenta by ⃗v = ⃗p/m √ 1 −v2 = ⃗p/p 0. Equation (3.92) is our ﬁnal expression relating the S-matrix to the diﬀerential cross section. You may now take your favorite scattering amplitude, and compute the probability for particles to ﬂy out at your favorite angles. This will involve doing the integral over the phase space of ﬁnal states, with measure dΠ. Notice that diﬀerent scattering amplitudes have diﬀerent momentum dependence and will result in diﬀerent angular dependence in scattering amplitudes. For example, in φ4 theory the amplitude for tree level scattering was simply A = −λ. This results in isotropic scattering. In contrast, for nucleon-nucleon scattering we have schematically A ∼(t −m2)−1 + (u −m2)−1. This gives rise to angular dependence in the diﬀerential cross-section, which follows from the fact that, for example, t = −2|⃗p|2(1 −cos θ), where θ is the angle between the incoming and outgoing particles. 3.7 Green’s Functions So far we’ve learnt to compute scattering amplitudes. These are nice and physical (well – they’re directly related to cross-sections and decay rates which are physical) but there are many questions we want to ask in quantum ﬁeld theory that aren’t directly related to scattering experiments. For example, we might want to compute the viscosity of the quark gluon plasma, or the optical conductivity in a tentative model of strange metals, or ﬁgure out the non-Gaussianity of density perturbations arising in the CMB from novel models of inﬂation. All of these questions are answered in the framework of quantum ﬁeld theory by computing elementary objects known as correlation functions. In this section we will brieﬂy deﬁne correlation functions, explain how to compute them using Feynman diagrams, and then relate them back to scattering amplitudes. We’ll leave the relationship to other physical phenomena to other courses. We’ll denote the true vacuum of the interacting theory as |Ω⟩. We’ll normalize H such that H |Ω⟩= 0 (3.93)\n\n– 75 – and ⟨Ω| Ω⟩= 1. Note that this is diﬀerent from the state we’ve called |0⟩which is the vacuum of the free theory and satisﬁes H0 |0⟩= 0. Deﬁne G(n)(x1, . . . , xn) = ⟨Ω| T φH(x1) . . . φH(xn) |Ω⟩ (3.94) where φH is φ in the Heisenberg picture of the full theory, rather than the interaction picture that we’ve been dealing with so far. The G(n) are called correlation functions, or Green’s functions. There are a number of diﬀerent ways of looking at these objects which tie together nicely. Let’s start by asking how to compute G(n) using Feynman diagrams. We prove the following result Claim: We use the notation φ1 = φ(x1), and write φ1H to denote the ﬁeld in the Heisenberg picture, and φ1I to denote the ﬁeld in the interaction picture. Then G(n)(x1, . . . , xn) = ⟨Ω| T φ1H . . . φnH |Ω⟩= ⟨0| Tφ1I . . . φnI S |0⟩\n\n⟨0| S |0⟩ (3.95) where the operators on the right-hand side are evaluated on |0⟩, the vacuum of the free theory. Proof: Take t1 > t2 > . . . > tn. Then we can drop the T and write the numerator of the right-hand side as\n\n⟨0| UI(+∞, t1)φ1I U(t1, t2) φ2I . . . φnI UI(tn, −∞) |0⟩ We’ll use the factors of UI(tk, tk+1) = T exp(−i R tk+1 tk HI) to convert each of the φI into φH and we choose operators in the two pictures to be equal at some arbitrary time t0. Then we can write\n\n⟨0| UI(+∞, t1)φ1I U(t1, t2) φ2I . . . φnI UI(tn, −∞) |0⟩\n\n= ⟨0| UI(+∞, t0)φ1H . . . φnH UI(t0, −∞) |0⟩ Now let’s deal with the two remaining U(t0, ±∞) at either end of the string of operators. Consider an arbitrary state |Ψ⟩and look at\n\n⟨Ψ| UI(t, −∞) |0⟩= ⟨Ψ| U(t, −∞) |0⟩ (3.96) where U(t, −∞) is the Schr¨odinger evolution operator, and the equality above follows because H0 |0⟩= 0. Now insert a complete set of states, which we take to be energy eigenstates of H = H0 + Hint, \"\n\n#\n\n|Ω⟩⟨Ω| + X\n\n⟨Ψ| U(t, −∞) |0⟩= ⟨Ψ| U(t, −∞) n̸=0 |n⟩⟨n|\n\n|0⟩ n̸=0 eiEn(t′−t) ⟨Ψ| n⟩⟨n| 0⟩ (3.97) X\n\n= ⟨Ψ| Ω⟩⟨Ω| 0⟩+ lim t′→−∞\n\n– 76 – But the last term vanishes. This follows from the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma which says that for any well-behaved function Z b a dx f(x)eiµx = 0 (3.98) lim µ→∞ n in (3.97) is really an integral R dn, because all states are part of a continuum due to the momentum. (There is a caveat here: we want the vacuum |Ω⟩to be special, so that it sits on its own, away from the continuum of the integral. This means that we must be working in a theory with a mass gap – i.e. with no massless particles). So the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma gives us Why is this relevant? The point is that the P lim t′→−∞⟨Ψ| U(t, t′) |0⟩= ⟨Ψ| Ω⟩⟨Ω| 0⟩ (3.99) (Notice that to derive this result, Peskin and Schroeder instead send t →−∞in a slightly imaginary direction, which also does the job). We now apply the formula (3.99), to the top and bottom of the right-hand side of (3.95) to ﬁnd\n\n⟨0| Ω⟩⟨Ω| Tφ1H . . . φnH |Ω⟩⟨Ω| 0⟩\n\n⟨0| Ω⟩⟨Ω| Ω⟩⟨Ω| 0⟩ (3.100) which, using the normalization ⟨Ω| Ω⟩= 1, gives us the left-hand side, completing the proof. □. 3.7.1 Connected Diagrams and Vacuum Bubbles We’re getting closer to our goal of computing the Green’s functions G(n) since we can compute both ⟨0| TφI(x1) . . . φI(xn) S |0⟩and ⟨0| S |0⟩using the same methods we developed for S-matrix elements; namely Dyson’s formula and Wick’s theorem or, alternatively, Feynman diagrams. But what about dividing one by the other? What’s that all about? In fact, it has a simple interpretation. For the following discussion, we will work in φ4 theory. Since there is no ambiguity in the diﬀerent types of line in Feynman diagrams, we will represent the φ particles as solid lines, rather than the dashed lines that we used previously. Then we have the diagramatic expansion for ⟨0| S |0⟩.\n\n⟨0| S |0⟩= 1 + +( + + ) + . . . (3.101) These diagrams are called vacuum bubbles. The combinatoric factors (as well as the symmetry factors) associated with each diagram are such that the whole series sums\n\n– 77 – to an exponential,\n\n⟨0| S |0⟩= exp ( + + + ...) (3.102) So the amplitude for the vacuum of the free theory to evolve into itself is ⟨0| S |0⟩= exp(all distinct vacuum bubbles). A similar combinatoric simpliﬁcation occurs for generic correlation functions. Remarkably, the vacuum diagrams all add up to give the same exponential. With a little thought one can show that\n\n⟨0| Tφ1 . . . φnS |0⟩= \u0010X connected diagrams \u0011 ⟨0| S |0⟩ (3.103) where “connected” means that every part of the diagram is connected to at least one of the external legs. The upshot of all this is that dividing by ⟨0| S |0⟩has a very nice interpretation in terms of Feynman diagrams: we need only consider the connected Feynman diagrams, and don’t have to worry about the vacuum bubbles. Combining this with (3.95), we learn that the Green’s functions G(n)(x1 . . . , xn) can be calculated by summing over all connected Feynman diagrams,\n\n⟨Ω| T φH(x1) . . . φH(xn) |Ω⟩= X Connected Feynman Graphs (3.104) An Example: The Four-Point Correlator: ⟨Ω| TφH(x1) . . . φH(x4) |Ω⟩ As a simple example, let’s look at the four-point correlation function in φ4 theory. The sum of connected Feynman diagrams is given by, x1 x2 x1 x2 x1 x2 x3 x4 + + + + 5 Similar + ... 2 Similar x3 x4 x3 x4 All of these are connected diagrams, even though they don’t look x1 x2 that connected! The point is that a connected diagram is deﬁned by the requirement that every line is joined to an external leg. An example of a diagram that is not connected is shown in the ﬁgure. As we have seen, such diagrams are taken care of in shifting the vacuum from |0⟩to |Ω⟩. x3 x4 Figure 20: Feynman Rules The Feynman diagrams that we need to calculate for the Green’s functions depend on x1, . . . , xn. This is rather diﬀerent than the Feynman diagrams that we calculated for\n\n– 78 – the S-matrix elements, where we were working primarily with momentum eigenstates, and ended up integrating over all of space. However, it’s rather simple to adapt the Feynman rules that we had earlier in momentum space to compute G(n)(x1 . . . , xn). For φ4 theory, we have\n\n• Draw n external points x1, . . . , xn, connected by the usual propagators and vertices. Assign a spacetime position y to the end of each line.\n\n• For each line x y from x to y write down a factor of the Feynman propagator ∆F(x −y).\n\n• For each vertex y at position y, write down a factor of −iλ R d4y. 3.7.2 From Green’s Functions to S-Matrices Having described how to compute correlation functions using Feynman diagrams, let’s now relate them back to the S-matrix elements that we already calculated. The ﬁrst step is to perform the Fourier transform,\n\n˜G(n)(p1, . . . , pn) = Z \" n Y i=1 d4xie−ipi·xi # G(n)(x1, . . . , xn) (3.105) These are very closely related to the S-matrix elements that we’ve computed above. The diﬀerence is that the Feynman rules for G(n)(x1, . . . , xn), eﬀectively include propagators ∆F for the external legs, as well as the internal legs. A related fact is that the 4momenta assigned to the external legs is arbitrary: they are not on-shell. Both of these problems are easily remedied to allow us to return to the S-matrix elements: we need to simply cancel oﬀthe propagators on the external legs, and place their momentum back on shell. We have\n\n⟨p′ 1, . . . , p′ n′| S −1 |p1 . . . , pn⟩= (−i)n+n′ n′ Y n Y i=1 (p ′ 2 i −m2) j=1 (p2 j −m2) (3.106)\n\n× ˜G(n+n′)(−p′ 1, . . . , −p′ n′, p1, . . . , pn) Each of the factors (p2−m2) vanishes once the momenta are placed on-shell. This means that we only get a non-zero answer for diagrams contributing to G(n)(x1, . . . , xn) which have propagators for each external leg. So what’s the point of all of this? We’ve understood that ignoring the unconnected diagrams is related to shifting to the true vacuum |Ω⟩. But other than that, introducing the Green’s functions seems like a lot of bother for little reward. The important point\n\n– 79 – is that this provides a framework in which to deal with the true particle states in the interacting theory through renormalization. Indeed, the formula (3.106), suitably interpreted, remains true even in the interacting theory, taking into account the swarm of virtual particles surrounding asymptotic states. This is the correct way to consider scattering. In this context, (3.106) is known as the LSZ reduction formula. You will derive it properly next term.\n\n– 80 – 4. The Dirac Equation “A great deal more was hidden in the Dirac equation than the author had expected when he wrote it down in 1928. Dirac himself remarked in one of his talks that his equation was more intelligent than its author. It should be added, however, that it was Dirac who found most of the additional insights.” Weisskopf on Dirac So far we’ve only discussed scalar ﬁelds such that under a Lorentz transformation xµ →(x′)µ = Λµ νxν, the ﬁeld transforms as\n\nφ(x) →φ′(x) = φ(Λ−1x) (4.1) We have seen that quantization of such ﬁelds gives rise to spin 0 particles. But most particles in Nature have an intrinsic angular momentum, or spin. These arise naturally in ﬁeld theory by considering ﬁelds which themselves transform non-trivially under the Lorentz group. In this section we will describe the Dirac equation, whose quantization gives rise to fermionic spin 1/2 particles. To motivate the Dirac equation, we will start by studying the appropriate representation of the Lorentz group. A familiar example of a ﬁeld which transforms non-trivially under the Lorentz group is the vector ﬁeld Aµ(x) of electromagnetism, Aµ(x) →Λµ νAν(Λ−1x) (4.2) We’ll deal with this in Section 6. (It comes with its own problems!). In general, a ﬁeld can transform as\n\nφa(x) →D[Λ]a b φb(Λ−1x) (4.3) where the matrices D[Λ] form a representation of the Lorentz group, meaning that D[Λ1]D[Λ2] = D[Λ1Λ2] (4.4) and D[Λ−1] = D[Λ]−1 and D[1] = 1. How do we ﬁnd the diﬀerent representations? Typically, we look at inﬁnitesimal transformations of the Lorentz group and study the resulting Lie algebra. If we write,\n\nΛµ ν = δµ ν + ωµ ν (4.5) for inﬁnitesimal ω, then the condition for a Lorentz transformation Λµ σΛν ρησρ = ηµν becomes the requirement that ω is anti-symmetric:\n\nωµν + ωνµ = 0 (4.6)\n\n– 81 – Note that an antisymmetric 4 × 4 matrix has 4 × 3/2 = 6 independent components, which agrees with the 6 transformations of the Lorentz group: 3 rotations and 3 boosts. It’s going to be useful to introduce a basis of these six 4 × 4 anti-symmetric matrices. We could call them (MA)µν, with A = 1, . . . , 6. But in fact it’s better for us (although initially a little confusing) to replace the single index A with a pair of antisymmetric indices [ρσ], where ρ, σ = 0, . . . , 3, so we call our matrices (Mρσ)µ ν. The antisymmetry on the ρ and σ indices means that, for example, M01 = −M10, etc, so that ρ and σ again label six diﬀerent matrices. Of course, the matrices are also antisymmetric on the µν indices because they are, after all, antisymmetric matrices. With this notation in place, we can write a basis of six 4 × 4 antisymmetric matrices as (Mρσ)µν = ηρµ ησν −ησµηρν (4.7) where the indices µ and ν are those of the 4 × 4 matrix, while ρ and σ denote which basis element we’re dealing with. If we use these matrices for anything practical (for example, if we want to multiply them together, or act on some ﬁeld) we will typically need to lower one index, so we have (Mρσ)µ ν = ηρµ δσ ν −ησµδρ ν (4.8) Since we lowered the index with the Minkowski metric, we pick up various minus signs which means that when written in this form, the matrices are no longer necessarily antisymmetric. Two examples of these basis matrices are,\n\n!\n\n!\n\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 and (M12)µ ν = (M01)µ ν = 0 0 −1 0 1 0 0 0 (4.9) 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 The ﬁrst, M01, generates boosts in the x1 direction. It is real and symmetric. The second, M12, generates rotations in the (x1, x2)-plane. It is real and antisymmetric. We can now write any ωµ ν as a linear combination of the Mρσ, 2 Ωρσ (Mρσ)µ ν (4.10)\n\nωµ ν = 1 where Ωρσ are just six numbers (again antisymmetric in the indices) that tell us what Lorentz transformation we’re doing. The six basis matrices Mρσ are called the generators of the Lorentz transformations. The generators obey the Lorentz Lie algebra relations, [Mρσ, Mτν] = ηστMρν −ηρτMσν + ηρνMστ −ησνMρτ (4.11)\n\n– 82 – where we have suppressed the matrix indices. A ﬁnite Lorentz transformation can then be expressed as the exponential\n\nΛ = exp \u0000 1 2 ΩρσMρσ\u0001 (4.12) Let me stress again what each of these objects are: the Mρσ are six 4×4 basis elements of the Lorentz Lie algebra; the Ωρσ are six numbers telling us what kind of Lorentz transformation we’re doing (for example, they say things like rotate by θ = π/7 about the x3-direction and run at speed v = 0.2 in the x1 direction). 4.1 The Spinor Representation We’re interested in ﬁnding other matrices which satisfy the Lorentz algebra commutation relations (4.11). We will construct the spinor representation. To do this, we start by deﬁning something which, at ﬁrst sight, has nothing to do with the Lorentz group. It is the Cliﬀord algebra,\n\n{γµ, γν} ≡γµγν + γνγµ = 2ηµν1 (4.13) where γµ, with µ = 0, 1, 2, 3, are a set of four matrices and the 1 on the right-hand side denotes the unit matrix. This means that we must ﬁnd four matrices such that\n\nγµγν = −γνγµ when µ ̸= ν (4.14) and (γ0)2 = 1 , (γi)2 = −1 i = 1, 2, 3 (4.15) It’s not hard to convince yourself that there are no representations of the Cliﬀord algebra using 2 × 2 or 3 × 3 matrices. The simplest representation of the Cliﬀord algebra is in terms of 4 × 4 matrices. There are many such examples of 4 × 4 matrices which obey (4.13). For example, we may take 0 1\n\n!\n\n0 σi\n\n!\n\nγ0 =\n\n, γi = (4.16)\n\n−σi 0 1 0 where each element is itself a 2 × 2 matrix, with the σi the Pauli matrices 0 1\n\n!\n\n0 −i\n\n!\n\n1 0\n\n!\n\nσ1 =\n\n, σ2 =\n\n, σ3 = (4.17) 0 −1 1 0 i 0 which themselves satisfy {σi, σj} = 2δij.\n\n– 83 – One can construct many other representations of the Cliﬀord algebra by taking V γµV −1 for any invertible matrix V . However, up to this equivalence, it turns out that there is a unique irreducible representation of the Cliﬀord algebra. The matrices (4.16) provide one example, known as the Weyl or chiral representation (for reasons that will soon become clear). We will soon restrict ourselves further, and consider only representations of the Cliﬀord algebra that are related to the chiral representation by a unitary transformation V . So what does the Cliﬀord algebra have to do with the Lorentz group? Consider the commutator of two γµ, ( 0 ρ = σ\n\n) Sρσ = 1 2γργσ −1 4 [γρ, γσ] = 2ηρσ (4.18)\n\n= 1 1 2 γργσ ρ ̸= σ Let’s see what properties these matrices have: Claim 4.1: [Sµν, γρ] = γµηνρ −γνηρµ Proof: When µ ̸= ν we have 2[γµγν, γρ] [Sµν, γρ] = 1 2γµγνγρ −1 2γργµγν\n\n= 1 2γµγργν −1 2{γρ, γµ }γν + 1 2γµ{γν, γρ} −1 2γµγργν\n\n= 1\n\n= γµηνρ −γνηρµ □ Claim 4.2: The matrices Sµν form a representation of the Lorentz algebra (4.11), meaning [Sµν, Sρσ] = ηνρSµσ −ηµρSνσ + ηµσSνρ −ηνσSµρ (4.19) Proof: Taking ρ ̸= σ, and using Claim 4.1 above, we have [Sµν, Sρσ] = 1 2[Sµν, γργσ] 2[Sµν, γρ]γσ + 1 2γρ[Sµν, γσ]\n\n= 1 2γµγσηνρ −1 2γργµηνσ −1 2γνγσηρµ + 1 2γργνησµ (4.20)\n\n= 1 Now using the expression (4.18) to write γµγσ = 2Sµσ + ηµσ, we have [Sµν, Sρσ] = Sµσηνρ −Sνσηρµ + Sρµηνσ −Sρνησµ (4.21) which is our desired expression. □\n\n– 84 – 4.1.1 Spinors The Sµν are 4 × 4 matrices, because the γµ are 4 × 4 matrices. So far we haven’t given an index name to the rows and columns of these matrices: we’re going to call them α, β = 1, 2, 3, 4. We need a ﬁeld for the matrices (Sµν)α β to act upon. We introduce the Dirac spinor ﬁeld ψα(x), an object with four complex components labelled by α = 1, 2, 3, 4. Under Lorentz transformations, we have\n\nψα(x) →S[Λ]α β ψβ(Λ−1x) (4.22) where\n\nΛ = exp \u0000 1 2 ΩρσMρσ\u0001 (4.23) S[Λ] = exp \u0000 1 2 ΩρσSρσ\u0001 (4.24) Although the basis of generators Mρσ and Sρσ are diﬀerent, we use the same six numbers Ωρσ in both Λ and S[Λ]: this ensures that we’re doing the same Lorentz transformation on x and ψ. Note that we denote both the generator Sρσ and the full Lorentz transformation S[Λ] as “S”. To avoid confusion, the latter will always come with the square brackets [Λ]. Both Λ and S[Λ] are 4 × 4 matrices. So how can we be sure that the spinor representation is something new, and isn’t equivalent to the familiar representation Λµ ν? To see that the two representations are truly diﬀerent, let’s look at some speciﬁc transformations. Rotations 2 ϵijk σk 0 0 σi\n\n! 0 σj\n\n!\n\n!\n\nSij = 1\n\n= −i (for i ̸= j) (4.25)\n\n−σi 0\n\n−σj 0 2 0 σk If we write the rotation parameters as Ωij = −ϵijkϕk (meaning Ω12 = −ϕ3, etc) then the rotation matrix becomes e+i ⃗ϕ·⃗σ/2 0\n\n!\n\nS[Λ] = exp \u0000 1 2 ΩρσSρσ\u0001 = (4.26) 0 e+i⃗ϕ·⃗σ/2 where we need to remember that Ω12 = −Ω21 = −ϕ3 when following factors of 2. Consider now a rotation by 2π about, say, the x3-axis. This is achieved by ⃗ϕ = (0, 0, 2π),\n\n– 85 – and the spinor rotation matrix becomes, e+iπσ3 0\n\n!\n\n= −1 (4.27) S[Λ] = 0 e+iπσ3 Therefore under a 2π rotation\n\nψα(x) →−ψα(x) (4.28) which is deﬁnitely not what happens to a vector! To check that we haven’t been cheating with factors of 2, let’s see how a vector would transform under a rotation by ⃗ϕ = (0, 0, ϕ3). We have 0 0 0 0\n\n!\n\nΛ = exp \u0000 1 0 0 ϕ3 0 2 ΩρσMρσ\u0001 = exp (4.29) 0 −ϕ3 0 0 0 0 0 0 So when we rotate a vector by ϕ3 = 2π, we learn that Λ = 1 as you would expect. So S[Λ] is deﬁnitely a diﬀerent representation from the familiar vector representation Λµ ν. Boosts\n\n−σi 0\n\n! 0 σi\n\n!\n\n!\n\n0 1\n\n= 1 S0i = 1 (4.30)\n\n−σi 0 2 2 0 σi 1 0 Writing the boost parameter as Ωi0 = −Ω0i = χi, we have\n\n!\n\ne+⃗χ·⃗σ/2 0 (4.31) S[Λ] = 0 e−⃗χ·⃗σ/2 Representations of the Lorentz Group are not Unitary Note that for rotations given in (4.26), S[Λ] is unitary, satisfying S[Λ]†S[Λ] = 1. But for boosts given in (4.31), S[Λ] is not unitary. In fact, there are no ﬁnite dimensional unitary representations of the Lorentz group. We have demonstrated this explicitly for the spinor representation using the chiral representation (4.16) of the Cliﬀord algebra. We can get a feel for why it is true for a spinor representation constructed from any representation of the Cliﬀord algebra. Recall that S[Λ] = exp \u0000 1 2 ΩρσSρσ\u0001 (4.32) so the representation is unitary if Sµν are anti-hermitian, i.e. (Sµν)† = −Sµν. But we have (Sµν)† = −1 4[(γµ)†, (γν)†] (4.33)\n\n– 86 – which can be anti-hermitian if all γµ are hermitian or all are anti-hermitian. However, we can never arrange for this to happen since (γ0)2 = 1 ⇒ Real Eigenvalues (γi)2 = −1 ⇒ Imaginary Eigenvalues (4.34) So we could pick γ0 to be hermitian, but we can only pick γi to be anti-hermitian. Indeed, in the chiral representation (4.16), the matrices have this property: (γ0)† = γ0 and (γi)† = −γi. In general there is no way to pick γµ such that Sµν are anti-hermitian. 4.2 Constructing an Action We now have a new ﬁeld to work with, the Dirac spinor ψ. We would like to construct a Lorentz invariant equation of motion. We do this by constructing a Lorentz invariant action. We will start in a naive way which won’t work, but will give us a clue how to proceed. Deﬁne\n\nψ†(x) = (ψ⋆)T(x) (4.35) which is the usual adjoint of a multi-component object. We could then try to form a Lorentz scalar by taking the product ψ†ψ, with the spinor indices summed over. Let’s see how this transforms under Lorentz transformations,\n\nψ(x) →S[Λ] ψ(Λ−1x)\n\nψ†(x) →ψ†(Λ−1x) S[Λ]† (4.36) So ψ†(x)ψ(x) →ψ†(Λ−1x)S[Λ]†S[Λ]ψ(Λ−1x). But, as we have seen, for some Lorentz transformation S[Λ]†S[Λ] ̸= 1 since the representation is not unitary. This means that ψ†ψ isn’t going to do it for us: it doesn’t have any nice transformation under the Lorentz group, and certainly isn’t a scalar. But now we see why it fails, we can also see how to proceed. Let’s pick a representation of the Cliﬀord algebra which, like the chiral representation (4.16), satisﬁes (γ0)† = γ0 and (γi)† = −γi. Then for all µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 we have\n\nγ0γµγ0 = (γµ)† (4.37) which, in turn, means that (Sµν)† = 1 4[(γν)†, (γµ)†] = −γ0Sµνγ0 (4.38)\n\n– 87 – so that S[Λ]† = exp \u0000 1 2 Ωρσ(Sρσ)†\u0001 = γ0 S[Λ]−1γ0 (4.39) With this in mind, we now deﬁne the Dirac adjoint\n\n¯ψ(x) = ψ†(x) γ0 (4.40) Let’s now see what Lorentz covariant objects we can form out of a Dirac spinor ψ and its adjoint ¯ψ. Claim 4.3: ¯ψψ is a Lorentz scalar. Proof: Under a Lorentz transformation,\n\n¯ψ(x) ψ(x) = ψ†(x) γ0 ψ(x)\n\n→ψ†(Λ−1x) S[Λ]†γ0 S[Λ]ψ(Λ−1x)\n\n= ψ†(Λ−1x) γ0 ψ(Λ−1x)\n\n= ¯ψ(Λ−1x) ψ(Λ−1x) (4.41) which is indeed the transformation law for a Lorentz scalar. □ Claim 4.4: ¯ψ γµ ψ is a Lorentz vector, which means that\n\n¯ψ(x) γµ ψ(x) →Λµ ν ¯ψ(Λ−1x) γν ψ(Λ−1x) (4.42) This equation means that we can treat the µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 index on the γµ matrices as a true vector index. In particular we can form Lorentz scalars by contracting it with other Lorentz indices. Proof: Suppressing the x argument, under a Lorentz transformation we have,\n\n¯ψ γµ ψ →¯ψ S[Λ]−1 γµ S[Λ]ψ (4.43) If ¯ψ γµ ψ is to transform as a vector, we must have S[Λ]−1 γµ S[Λ] = Λµ νγν (4.44) We’ll now show this. We work inﬁnitesimally, so that\n\nΛ = exp \u0000 1 2ΩρσMρσ + . . . (4.45) 2 ΩρσMρσ\u0001 ≈1 + 1 S[Λ] = exp \u0000 1 2ΩρσSρσ + . . . (4.46) 2 ΩρσSρσ\u0001 ≈1 + 1\n\n– 88 – so the requirement (4.44) becomes\n\n−[Sρσ, γµ] = (Mρσ)µ νγν (4.47) where we’ve suppressed the α, β indices on γµ and Sµν, but otherwise left all other indices explicit. In fact equation (4.47) follows from Claim 4.1 where we showed that [Sρσ, γµ] = γρησµ −γσηµρ. To see this, we write the right-hand side of (4.47) by expanding out M, (Mρσ)µ νγν = (ηρµδσ ν −ησµδρ ν)γν\n\n= ηρµγσ −ησµγρ (4.48) which means that the proof follows if we can show\n\n−[Sρσ, γµ] = ηρµγσ −ησµγρ (4.49) which is exactly what we proved in Claim 4.1. □ Claim 4.5: ¯ψγµγνψ transforms as a Lorentz tensor. More precisely, the symmetric part is a Lorentz scalar, proportional to ηµν ¯ψψ, while the antisymmetric part is a Lorentz tensor, proportional to ¯ψSµνψ. Proof: As above. □ We are now armed with three bilinears of the Dirac ﬁeld, ¯ψψ, ¯ψγµψ and ¯ψγµγνψ, each of which transforms covariantly under the Lorentz group. We can try to build a Lorentz invariant action from these. In fact, we need only the ﬁrst two. We choose S = Z d4x ¯ψ(x) (iγµ∂µ −m) ψ(x) (4.50) This is the Dirac action. The factor of “i” is there to make the action real; upon complex conjugation, it cancels a minus sign that comes from integration by parts. (Said another way, it’s there for the same reason that the Hermitian momentum operator −i∇in quantum mechanics has a factor i). As we will see in the next section, after quantization this theory describes particles and anti-particles of mass |m| and spin 1/2. Notice that the Lagrangian is ﬁrst order, rather than the second order Lagrangians we were working with for scalar ﬁelds. Also, the mass appears in the Lagrangian as m, which can be positive or negative.\n\n– 89 – 4.3 The Dirac Equation The equation of motion follows from the action (4.50) by varying with respect to ψ and ¯ψ independently. Varying with respect to ¯ψ, we have (iγµ∂µ −m) ψ = 0 (4.51) This is the Dirac equation. It’s completely gorgeous. Varying with respect to ψ gives the conjugate equation i∂µ ¯ψ γµ + m ¯ψ = 0 (4.52) The Dirac equation is ﬁrst order in derivatives, yet miraculously Lorentz invariant. If we tried to write down a ﬁrst order equation of motion for a scalar ﬁeld, it would look like vµ∂µφ = . . ., which necessarily includes a privileged vector in spacetime vµ and is not Lorentz invariant. However, for spinor ﬁelds, the magic of the γµ matrices means that the Dirac Lagrangian is Lorentz invariant. The Dirac equation mixes up diﬀerent components of ψ through the matrices γµ. However, each individual component itself solves the Klein-Gordon equation. To see this, write (iγν∂ν + m)(iγµ∂µ −m) ψ = − \u0000 γµγν∂µ∂ν + m2\u0001 ψ = 0 (4.53) But γµγν∂µ∂ν = 1 2{γµ, γν}∂µ∂ν = ∂µ∂µ, so we get\n\n−(∂µ∂µ + m2)ψ = 0 (4.54) where this last equation has no γµ matrices, and so applies to each component ψα, with α = 1, 2, 3, 4. The Slash Let’s introduce some useful notation. We will often come across 4-vectors contracted with γµ matrices. We write Aµγµ ≡/A (4.55) so the Dirac equation reads (i /∂−m)ψ = 0 (4.56)\n\n– 90 – 4.4 Chiral Spinors When we’ve needed an explicit form of the γµ matrices, we’ve used the chiral representation 0 1\n\n!\n\n0 σi\n\n!\n\nγ0 =\n\n, γi = (4.57)\n\n−σi 0 1 0 In this representation, the spinor rotation transformation S[Λrot] and boost transformation S[Λboost] were computed in (4.26) and (4.31). Both are block diagonal, e+i ⃗ϕ·⃗σ/2 0\n\n!\n\ne+⃗χ·⃗σ/2 0\n\n!\n\nS[Λrot] = and S[Λboost] = (4.58) 0 e+i⃗ϕ·⃗σ/2 0 e−⃗χ·⃗σ/2 This means that the Dirac spinor representation of the Lorentz group is reducible. It decomposes into two irreducible representations, acting only on two-component spinors u± which, in the chiral representation, are deﬁned by u+ u−\n\n!\n\nψ = (4.59) The two-component objects u± are called Weyl spinors or chiral spinors. They transform in the same way under rotations, u± →ei⃗ϕ·⃗σ/2 u± (4.60) but oppositely under boosts, u± →e±⃗χ·⃗σ/2u± (4.61) In group theory language, u+ is in the (1 2, 0) representation of the Lorentz group, while u−is in the (0, 1 2) representation. The Dirac spinor ψ lies in the (1 2, 0) ⊕(0, 1 2) representation. (Strictly speaking, the spinor is a representation of the double cover of the Lorentz group SL(2, C)). 4.4.1 The Weyl Equation Let’s see what becomes of the Dirac Lagrangian under the decomposition (4.59) into Weyl spinors. We have L = ¯ψ(i /∂−m)ψ = iu† −σµ∂µu−+ iu† +¯σµ∂µu+ −m(u† +u−+ u† −u+) = 0 (4.62)\n\n– 91 – where we have introduced some new notation for the Pauli matrices with a µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 index,\n\nσµ = (1, σi) and ¯σµ = (1, −σi) (4.63) From (4.62), we see that a massive fermion requires both u+ and u−, since they couple through the mass term. However, a massless fermion can be described by u+ (or u−) alone, with the equation of motion i¯σµ∂µu+ = 0 or iσµ∂µu−= 0 (4.64) These are the Weyl equations. Degrees of Freedom Let me comment here on the degrees of freedom in a spinor. The Dirac fermion has 4 complex components = 8 real components. How do we count degrees of freedom? In classical mechanics, the number of degrees of freedom of a system is equal to the dimension of the conﬁguration space or, equivalently, half the dimension of the phase space. In ﬁeld theory we have an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, but it makes sense to count the number of degrees of freedom per spatial point: this should at least be ﬁnite. For example, in this sense a real scalar ﬁeld φ has a single degree of freedom. At the quantum level, this translates to the fact that it gives rise to a single type of particle. A classical complex scalar ﬁeld has two degrees of freedom, corresponding to the particle and the anti-particle in the quantum theory. But what about a Dirac spinor? One might think that there are 8 degrees of freedom. But this isn’t right. Crucially, and in contrast to the scalar ﬁeld, the equation of motion is ﬁrst order rather than second order. In particular, for the Dirac Lagrangian, the momentum conjugate to the spinor ψ is given by\n\nπψ = ∂L/∂˙ψ = iψ† (4.65) It is not proportional to the time derivative of ψ. This means that the phase space for a spinor is therefore parameterized by ψ and ψ†, while for a scalar it is parameterized by φ and π = ˙φ. So the phase space of the Dirac spinor ψ has 8 real dimensions and correspondingly the number of real degrees of freedom is 4. We will see in the next section that, in the quantum theory, this counting manifests itself as two degrees of freedom (spin up and down) for the particle, and a further two for the anti-particle. A similar counting for the Weyl fermion tells us that it has two degrees of freedom.\n\n– 92 – 4.4.2 γ5 The Lorentz group matrices S[Λ] came out to be block diagonal in (4.58) because we chose the speciﬁc representation (4.57). In fact, this is why the representation (4.57) is called the chiral representation: it’s because the decomposition of the Dirac spinor ψ is simply given by (4.59). But what happens if we choose a diﬀerent representation γµ of the Cliﬀord algebra, so that\n\nγµ →UγµU −1 and ψ →Uψ ? (4.66) Now S[Λ] will not be block diagonal. Is there an invariant way to deﬁne chiral spinors? We can do this by introducing the “ﬁfth” gamma-matrix\n\nγ5 = −iγ0γ1γ2γ3 (4.67) You can check that this matrix satisﬁes\n\n{γ5, γµ} = 0 and (γ5)2 = +1 (4.68) The reason that this is called γ5 is because the set of matrices ˜γA = (γµ, iγ5), with A = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 satisfy the ﬁve-dimensional Cliﬀord algebra {˜γA, ˜γB} = 2ηAB. (You might think that γ4 would be a better name! But γ5 is the one everyone chooses - it’s a more sensible name in Euclidean space, where A = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). You can also check that [Sµν, γ5] = 0, which means that γ5 is a scalar under rotations and boosts. Since (γ5)2 = 1, this means we may form the Lorentz invariant projection operators P± = 1 2 \u0000 1 ± γ5\u0001 (4.69) such that P 2 + = P+ and P 2 −= P−and P+P−= 0. One can check that for the chiral representation (4.57), 1 0\n\n!\n\nγ5 = (4.70) 0 −1 from which we see that the operators P± project onto the Weyl spinors u±. However, for an arbitrary representation of the Cliﬀord algebra, we may use γ5 to deﬁne the chiral spinors,\n\nψ± = P±ψ (4.71) which form the irreducible representations of the Lorentz group. ψ+ is often called a “left-handed” spinor, while ψ−is “right-handed”. The name comes from the way the spin precesses as a massless fermion moves: we’ll see this in Section 4.7.2.\n\n– 93 – 4.4.3 Parity The spinors ψ± are related to each other by parity. Let’s pause to deﬁne this concept. The Lorentz group is deﬁned by xµ →Λµ νxν such that\n\nΛµ νΛρ σηνσ = ηµρ (4.72) So far we have only considered transformations Λ which are continuously connected to the identity; these are the ones which have an inﬁnitesimal form. However there are also two discrete symmetries which are part of the Lorentz group. They are Time Reversal T : x0 →−x0 ; xi →xi Parity P : x0 →x0 ; xi →−xi (4.73) We won’t discuss time reversal too much in this course. (It turns out to be represented by an anti-unitary transformation on states. See, for example the book by Peskin and Schroeder). But parity has an important role to play in the standard model and, in particular, the theory of the weak interaction. Under parity, the left and right-handed spinors are exchanged. This follows from the transformation of the spinors under the Lorentz group. In the chiral representation, we saw that the rotation (4.60) and boost (4.61) transformations for the Weyl spinors u± are u± rot −→ei⃗ϕ·⃗σ/2 u± and u± boost −→e±⃗χ·⃗σ/2u± (4.74) Under parity, rotations don’t change sign. But boosts do ﬂip sign. This conﬁrms that parity exchanges right-handed and left-handed spinors, P : u± →u∓, or in the notation ψ± = 1 2(1 ± γ5)ψ, we have P : ψ±(⃗x, t) →ψ∓(−⃗x, t) (4.75) Using this knowledge of how chiral spinors transform, and the fact that P 2 = 1, we see that the action of parity on the Dirac spinor itself can be written as P : ψ(⃗x, t) →γ0ψ(−⃗x, t) (4.76) Notice that if ψ(⃗x, t) satisﬁes the Dirac equation, then the parity transformed spinor γ0ψ(−⃗x, t) also satisﬁes the Dirac equation, meaning (iγ0∂t + iγi∂i −m)γ0ψ(−⃗x, t) = γ0(iγ0∂t −iγi∂i −m)ψ(−⃗x, t) = 0 (4.77) where the extra minus sign from passing γ0 through γi is compensated by the derivative acting on −⃗x instead of +⃗x.\n\n– 94 – 4.4.4 Chiral Interactions Let’s now look at how our interaction terms change under parity. We can look at each of our spinor bilinears from which we built the action, P : ¯ψψ(⃗x, t) →¯ψψ(−⃗x, t) (4.78) which is the transformation of a scalar. For the vector ¯ψγµψ, we can look at the temporal and spatial components separately, P : ¯ψγ0ψ(⃗x, t) →¯ψγ0ψ(−⃗x, t) P : ¯ψγiψ(⃗x, t) →¯ψγ0γiγ0ψ(−⃗x, t) = −¯ψγiψ(−⃗x, t) (4.79) which tells us that ¯ψγµψ transforms as a vector, with the spatial part changing sign. You can also check that ¯ψSµνψ transforms as a suitable tensor. However, now we’ve discovered the existence of γ5, we can form another Lorentz scalar and another Lorentz vector,\n\n¯ψγ5ψ and ¯ψγ5γµψ (4.80) How do these transform under parity? We can check: P : ¯ψγ5ψ(⃗x, t) →¯ψγ0γ5γ0 ψ(−⃗x, t) = −¯ψγ5ψ(−⃗x, t) (4.81) ( −¯ψγ5γ0ψ(−⃗x, t) µ = 0 P : ¯ψγ5γµψ(⃗x, t) →¯ψγ0γ5γµγ0ψ(−⃗x, t) =\n\n+ ¯ψγ5γiψ(−⃗x, t) µ = i which means that ¯ψγ5ψ transforms as a pseudoscalar, while ¯ψγ5γµψ transforms as an axial vector. To summarize, we have the following spinor bilinears,\n\n¯ψψ : scalar ¯ψγµψ : vector ¯ψSµνψ : tensor ¯ψγ5ψ : pseudoscalar ¯ψγ5γµψ : axial vector (4.82) The total number of bilinears is 1 + 4 + (4 × 3/2) + 4 + 1 = 16 which is all we could hope for from a 4-component object.\n\n– 95 – We’re now armed with new terms involving γ5 that we can start to add to our Lagrangian to construct new theories. Typically such terms will break parity invariance of the theory, although this is not always true. (For example, the term φ ¯ψγ5ψ doesn’t break parity if φ is itself a pseudoscalar). Nature makes use of these parity violating interactions by using γ5 in the weak force. A theory which treats ψ± on an equal footing is called a vector-like theory. A theory in which ψ+ and ψ−appear diﬀerently is called a chiral theory. 4.5 Majorana Fermions Our spinor ψα is a complex object. It has to be because the representation S[Λ] is typically also complex. This means that if we were to try to make ψ real, for example by imposing ψ = ψ⋆, then it wouldn’t stay that way once we make a Lorentz transformation. However, there is a way to impose a reality condition on the Dirac spinor ψ. To motivate this possibility, it’s simplest to look at a novel basis for the Cliﬀord algebra, known as the Majorana basis. iσ3 0 0 σ2\n\n!\n\n!\n\n0 −σ2\n\n!\n\n−iσ1 0\n\n!\n\nγ0 =\n\n, γ1 =\n\n, γ2 =\n\n, γ3 =\n\nσ2 0 0 iσ3\n\nσ2 0 0 −iσ1 These matrices satisfy the Cliﬀord algebra. What is special about them is that they are all pure imaginary (γµ)⋆= −γµ. This means that the generators of the Lorentz group Sµν = 1 4[γµ, γν], and hence the matrices S[Λ] are real. So with this basis of the Cliﬀord algebra, we can work with a real spinor simply by imposing the condition,\n\nψ = ψ⋆ (4.83) which is preserved under Lorentz transformation. Such spinors are called Majorana spinors. So what’s the story if we use a general basis for the Cliﬀord algebra? We’ll ask only that the basis satisﬁes (γ0)† = γ0 and (γi)† = −γi. We then deﬁne the charge conjugate of a Dirac spinor ψ as\n\nψ(c) = Cψ⋆ (4.84) Here C is a 4 × 4 matrix satisfying C†C = 1 and C†γµC = −(γµ)⋆ (4.85) Let’s ﬁrstly check that (4.84) is a good deﬁnition, meaning that ψ(c) transforms nicely under a Lorentz transformation. We have\n\nψ(c) →CS[Λ]⋆ψ⋆= S[Λ]Cψ⋆= S[Λ]ψ(c) (4.86)\n\n– 96 – where we’ve made use of the properties (4.85) in taking the matrix C through S[Λ]⋆. In fact, not only does ψ(c) transform nicely under the Lorentz group, but if ψ satisﬁes the Dirac equation, then ψ(c) does too. This follows from, (i /∂−m)ψ = 0 ⇒ (−i /∂ ⋆−m)ψ⋆= 0\n\n⇒ C(−i /∂ ⋆−m)ψ⋆= (+i /∂−m)ψ(c) = 0 Finally, we can now impose the Lorentz invariant reality condition on the Dirac spinor, to yield a Majorana spinor,\n\nψ(c) = ψ (4.87) After quantization, the Majorana spinor gives rise to a fermion that is its own antiparticle. This is exactly the same as in the case of scalar ﬁelds, where we’ve seen that a real scalar ﬁeld gives rise to a spin 0 boson that is its own anti-particle. (Be aware: In many texts an extra factor of γ0 is absorbed into the deﬁnition of C). So what is this matrix C? Well, for a given representation of the Cliﬀord algebra, it is something that we can ﬁnd fairly easily. In the Majorana basis, where the gamma matrices are pure imaginary, we have simply CMaj = 1 and the Majorana condition ψ = ψ(c) becomes ψ = ψ⋆. In the chiral basis (4.16), only γ2 is imaginary, and we may take Cchiral = iγ2 = \u0010 0 iσ2\n\n−iσ2 0 \u0011 . (The matrix iσ2 that appears here is simply the anti-symmetric matrix ϵαβ). It is interesting to see how the Majorana condition (4.87) looks in terms of the decomposition into left and right handed Weyl spinors (4.59). Plugging in the various deﬁnitions, we ﬁnd that u+ = iσ2u⋆ −and u−= −iσ2u⋆ +. In other words, a Majorana spinor can be written in terms of Weyl spinors as u+ −iσ2u⋆ +\n\n!\n\nψ = (4.88) Notice that it’s not possible to impose the Majorana condition ψ = ψ(c) at the same time as the Weyl condition (u−= 0 or u+ = 0). Instead the Majorana condition relates u−and u+. An Aside: Spinors in Diﬀerent Dimensions: The ability to impose Majorana or Weyl conditions on Dirac spinors depends on both the dimension and the signature of spacetime. One can always impose the Weyl condition on a spinor in even dimensional Minkowski space, basically because you can always build a suitable “γ5” projection matrix by multiplying together all the other γ-matrices. The pattern for when the Majorana condition can be imposed is a little more sporadic. Interestingly, although the Majorana condition and Weyl condition cannot be imposed simultaneously in four dimensions, you can do this in Minowski spacetimes of dimension 2, 10, 18, . . ..\n\n– 97 – 4.6 Symmetries and Conserved Currents The Dirac Lagrangian enjoys a number of symmetries. Here we list them and compute the associated conserved currents. Spacetime Translations Under spacetime translations the spinor transforms as\n\nδψ = ϵµ∂µψ (4.89) The Lagrangian depends on ∂µψ, but not ∂µ ¯ψ, so the standard formula (1.41) gives us the energy-momentum tensor T µν = i ¯ψγµ∂νψ −ηµνL (4.90) Since a current is conserved only when the equations of motion are obeyed, we don’t lose anything by imposing the equations of motion already on T µν. In the case of a scalar ﬁeld this didn’t really buy us anything because the equations of motion are second order in derivatives, while the energy-momentum is typically ﬁrst order. However, for a spinor ﬁeld the equations of motion are ﬁrst order: (i /∂−m)ψ = 0. This means we can set L = 0 in T µν, leaving T µν = i ¯ψγµ∂νψ (4.91) In particular, we have the total energy E = Z d3x T 00 = Z d3x i ¯ψγ0 ˙ψ = Z d3x ψ†γ0(−iγi∂i + m)ψ (4.92) where, in the last equality, we have again used the equations of motion. Lorentz Transformations Under an inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation, the Dirac spinor transforms as (4.22) which, in inﬁnitesimal form, reads\n\nδψα = −ωµ νxν∂µψα + 1 2Ωρσ(Sρσ)α βψβ (4.93) 2Ωρσ(Mρσ)µ ν, and Mρσ are the generators of the Lorentz algebra given by (4.8) where, following (4.10), we have ωµ ν = 1 (Mρσ)µ ν = ηρµ δσ ν −ησµδρ ν (4.94)\n\n– 98 – which, after direct substitution, tells us that ωµν = Ωµν. So we get\n\nδψα = −ωµν \u0002 xν∂µψα −1 2(Sµν)α βψβ\u0003 (4.95) The conserved current arising from Lorentz transformations now follows from the same calculation we saw for the scalar ﬁeld (1.54) with two diﬀerences: ﬁrstly, as we saw above, the spinor equations of motion set L = 0; secondly, we pick up an extra piece in the current from the second term in (4.95). We have (J µ)ρσ = xρT µσ −xσT µρ −i ¯ψγµSρσψ (4.96) After quantization, when (J µ)ρσ is turned into an operator, this extra term will be responsible for providing the single particle states with internal angular momentum, telling us that the quantization of a Dirac spinor gives rise to a particle carrying spin 1/2. Internal Vector Symmetry The Dirac Lagrangian is invariant under rotating the phase of the spinor, ψ →e−iαψ. This gives rise to the current jµ V = ¯ψγµψ (4.97) where “V ” stands for vector, reﬂecting the fact that the left and right-handed components ψ± transform in the same way under this symmetry. We can easily check that jµ V is conserved under the equations of motion,\n\n∂µjµ V = (∂µ ¯ψ)γµψ + ¯ψγµ(∂µψ) = im ¯ψψ −im ¯ψψ = 0 (4.98) where, in the last equality, we have used the equations of motion i /∂ψ = mψ and i∂µ ¯ψγµ = −m ¯ψ. The conserved quantity arising from this symmetry is Q = Z d3x ¯ψγ0ψ = Z d3x ψ†ψ (4.99) We will see shortly that this has the interpretation of electric charge, or particle number, for fermions. Axial Symmetry When m = 0, the Dirac Lagrangian admits an extra internal symmetry which rotates left and right-handed fermions in opposite directions,\n\nψ →eiαγ5ψ and ¯ψ →¯ψeiαγ5 (4.100)\n\n– 99 – Here the second transformation follows from the ﬁrst after noting that e−iαγ5γ0 = γ0e+iαγ5. This gives the conserved current, jµ A = ¯ψγµγ5ψ (4.101) where A is for “axial” since jµ A is an axial vector. This is conserved only when m = 0. Indeed, with the full Dirac Lagrangian we may compute\n\n∂µjµ A = (∂µ ¯ψ)γµγ5ψ + ¯ψγµγ5∂µψ = 2im ¯ψγ5ψ (4.102) which vanishes only for m = 0. However, in the quantum theory things become more interesting for the axial current. When the theory is coupled to gauge ﬁelds (in a manner we will discuss in Section 6), the axial transformation remains a symmetry of the classical Lagrangian. But it doesn’t survive the quantization process. It is the archetypal example of an anomaly: a symmetry of the classical theory that is not preserved in the quantum theory. 4.7 Plane Wave Solutions Let’s now study the solutions to the Dirac equation (iγµ∂µ −m)ψ = 0 (4.103) We start by making a simple ansatz:\n\nψ = u(⃗p) e−ip·x (4.104) where u(⃗p) is a four-component spinor, independent of spacetime x which, as the notation suggests, can depend on the 3-momentum ⃗p. The Dirac equation then becomes\n\n−m pµσµ\n\n!\n\n(γµpµ −m)u(⃗p) = u(⃗p) = 0 (4.105) pµ¯σµ −m where we’re again using the deﬁnition,\n\nσµ = (1, σi) and ¯σµ = (1, −σi) (4.106) Claim: The solution to (4.105) is\n\n√p · σ ξ √p · ¯σ ξ\n\n!\n\nu(⃗p) = (4.107)\n\n– 100 – for any 2-component spinor ξ which we will normalize to ξ†ξ = 1. Proof: Let’s write u(⃗p)T = (u1, u2). Then equation (4.105) reads (p · σ) u2 = mu1 and (p · ¯σ)u1 = mu2 (4.108) Either one of these equations implies the other, a fact which follows from the identity (p · σ)(p · ¯σ) = p2 0 −pipjσiσj = p2 0 −pipjδij = pµpµ = m2. To start with, let’s try the ansatz u1 = (p · σ)ξ′ for some spinor ξ′. Then the second equation in (4.108) immediately tells us that u2 = mξ′. So we learn that any spinor of the form (p · σ) ξ′\n\n!\n\nu(⃗p) = A (4.109) mξ′ with constant A is a solution to (4.105). To make this more symmetric, we choose A = 1/m and ξ′ = √p · ¯σ ξ with constant ξ. Then u1 = (p · σ)√p · ¯σ ξ = m√p · σ ξ. So we get the promised result (4.107) □ Negative Frequency Solutions We get further solutions to the Dirac equation from the ansatz\n\nψ = v(⃗p) e+ip·x (4.110) Solutions of the form (4.104), which oscillate in time as ψ ∼e−iEt, are called positive frequency solutions. Those of the form (4.110), which oscillate as ψ ∼e+iEt, are negative frequency solutions. It’s important to note however that both are solutions to the classical ﬁeld equations and both have positive energy (4.92). The Dirac equation requires that the 4-component spinor v(⃗p) satisﬁes m pµσµ\n\n!\n\n(γµpµ + m)v(⃗p) = v(⃗p) = 0 (4.111) pµ¯σµ m which is solved by\n\n√p · σ η\n\n!\n\nv(⃗p) = (4.112)\n\n−√p · ¯σ η for some 2-component spinor η which we take to be constant and normalized to η†η = 1.\n\n– 101 – 4.7.1 Some Examples Consider the positive frequency solution with mass m and 3-momentum ⃗p = 0,\n\nξ\n\n!\n\nu(⃗p) = √m (4.113)\n\nξ where ξ is any 2-component spinor. Spatial rotations of the ﬁeld act on ξ by (4.26),\n\nξ →e+i⃗ϕ·⃗σ/2ξ (4.114) The 2-component spinor ξ deﬁnes the spin of the ﬁeld. This should be familiar from quantum mechanics. A ﬁeld with spin up (down) along a given direction is described by the eigenvector of the corresponding Pauli matrix with eigenvalue +1 (-1 respectively). For example, ξT = (1, 0) describes a ﬁeld with spin up along the z-axis. After quantization, this will become the spin of the associated particle. In the rest of this section, we’ll indulge in an abuse of terminology and refer to the classical solutions to the Dirac equations as “particles”, even though they have no such interpretation before quantization. Consider now boosting the particle with spin ξT = (1, 0) along the x3 direction, with pµ = (E, 0, 0, p). The solution to the Dirac equation becomes\n\n √p · σ \u0010 1 0 \u0011 0 \u0011 E −p3 \u0010 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n p\n\n (4.115)\n\n= u(⃗p) =\n\n√p · ¯σ \u0010 1\n\n 0 \u0011 0 \u0011 E + p3 \u0010 1 p In fact, this expression also makes sense for a massless ﬁeld, for which E = p3. (We picked the normalization (4.107) for the solutions so that this would be the case). For a massless particle we have 0\n\n!\n\nu(⃗p) = √ 0 2E (4.116) 1 0 Similarly, for a boosted solution of the spin down ξT = (0, 1) ﬁeld, we have\n\n √p · σ \u0010 0 1 \u0011 E + p3 \u0010 0 1 \u0011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n p 0\n\n!\n\n m→0 −→ √ 1 u(⃗p) = 2E\n\n= (4.117)\n\n√p · ¯σ \u0010 0\n\n 1 \u0011 E −p3 \u0010 0 1 \u0011 0 p 0\n\n– 102 – 4.7.2 Helicity The helicity operator is the projection of the angular momentum along the direction of momentum,\n\nσi 0\n\n!\n\n2ϵijkˆpi Sjk = 1 h = i 2 ˆpi (4.118) 0 σi where Sij is the rotation generator given in (4.25). The massless ﬁeld with spin ξT = (1, 0) in (4.116) has helicity h = 1/2: we say that it is right-handed. Meanwhile, the ﬁeld (4.117) has helicity h = −1/2: it is left-handed. 4.7.3 Some Useful Formulae: Inner and Outer Products There are a number of identities that will be very useful in the following section, regarding the inner (and outer) products of the spinors u(⃗p) and v(⃗p). It’s ﬁrstly convenient to introduce a basis ξs and ηs, s = 1, 2 for the two-component spinors such that\n\nξr †ξs = δrs and ηr †ηs = δrs (4.119) for example, 1\n\n!\n\n0\n\n!\n\nξ1 = and ξ2 = (4.120) 0 1 and similarly for ηs. Let’s deal ﬁrst with the positive frequency plane waves. The two independent solutions are now written as\n\n√p · σ ξs √p · ¯σ ξs\n\n!\n\nus(⃗p) = (4.121) We can take the inner product of four-component spinors in two diﬀerent ways: either as u† ·u, or as ¯u·u. Of course, only the latter will be Lorentz invariant, but it turns out that the former is needed when we come to quantize the theory. Here we state both: ur †(⃗p) · us(⃗p) = \u0000 ξr † √p · σ , ξr †√p · ¯σ \u0001 √p · σ ξs √p · ¯σ ξs\n\n!\n\n= ξr †p · σξs + ξr †p · ¯σξs = 2ξr †p0ξs = 2p0δrs (4.122) while the Lorentz invariant inner product is\n\n! √p · σ ξs √p · ¯σ ξs\n\n¯ur(⃗p) · us(⃗p) = \u0000 ξr † √p · σ , ξr †√p · ¯σ \u0001 0 1\n\n!\n\n= 2mδrs (4.123) 1 0\n\n– 103 – We have analogous results for the negative frequency solutions, which we may write as\n\n√p · σ ηs\n\n! with vr †(⃗p) · vs(⃗p) = 2p0δrs vs(⃗p) = and ¯vr(⃗p) · vs(⃗p) = −2mδrs (4.124)\n\n−√p · ¯σ ηs We can also compute the inner product between u and v. We have\n\n¯ur(⃗p) · vs(⃗p) = \u0000 ξr † √p · σ , ξr †√p · ¯σ \u0001 γ0 √p · σ ηs\n\n!\n\n−√p · ¯σ ηs (p · ¯σ)(p · σ)ηs −ξr †p (p · ¯σ)(p · σ)ηs = 0 (4.125)\n\n= ξr†p and similarly, ¯vr(⃗p) · us(⃗p) = 0. However, when we come to u† · v, it is a slightly diﬀerent combination that has nice properties (and this same combination appears when we quantize the theory). We look at ur †(⃗p) · vs(−⃗p), with the 3-momentum in the spinor v taking the opposite sign. Deﬁning the 4-momentum (p′)µ = (p0, −⃗p), we have ur †(⃗p) · vs(−⃗p) = \u0000 ξr † √p · σ , ξr †√p · ¯σ \u0001 √p′ · σ ηs\n\n!\n\n−√p′ · ¯σ ηs (p · σ)(p′ · σ)ηs −ξr †p (p · ¯σ)(p′ · ¯σ)ηs (4.126)\n\n= ξr†p Now the terms under the square-root are given by (p·σ)(p′·σ) = (p0+piσi)(p0−piσi) = p2 0 −⃗p 2 = m2. The same expression holds for (p · ¯σ)(p′ · ¯σ), and the two terms cancel. We learn ur †(⃗p) · vs(−⃗p) = vr †(⃗p) · us(−⃗p) = 0 (4.127) Outer Products There’s one last spinor identity that we need before we turn to the quantum theory. It is: Claim: 2 X s=1 us(⃗p) ¯us(⃗p) = /p + m (4.128) where the two spinors are not now contracted, but instead placed back to back to give a 4 × 4 matrix. Also, 2 X s=1 vs(⃗p) ¯vs(⃗p) = /p −m (4.129)\n\n– 104 – Proof:\n\n√p · σ ξs √p · ¯σ ξs\n\n! \u0000 ξs † √p · ¯σ , ξs †√p · σ \u0001 (4.130) 2 X 2 X s=1 us(⃗p) ¯us(⃗p) = s=1 s ξs ξs † = 1, the 2 × 2 unit matrix, which then gives us But P m p · σ\n\n!\n\n2 X s=1 us(⃗p)¯us(⃗p) = (4.131) p · ¯σ m s vs(⃗p)¯vs(⃗p). □ which is the desired result. A similar proof works for P\n\n– 105 – 5. Quantizing the Dirac Field We would now like to quantize the Dirac Lagrangian, L = ¯ψ(x) \u0000 i /∂−m \u0001 ψ(x) (5.1) We will proceed naively and treat ψ as we did the scalar ﬁeld. But we’ll see that things go wrong and we will have to reconsider how to quantize this theory. 5.1 A Glimpse at the Spin-Statistics Theorem We start in the usual way and deﬁne the momentum,\n\nπ = ∂L\n\n∂˙ψ = i ¯ψγ0 = iψ† (5.2) For the Dirac Lagrangian, the momentum conjugate to ψ is iψ†. It does not involve the time derivative of ψ. This is as it should be for an equation of motion that is ﬁrst order in time, rather than second order. This is because we need only specify ψ and ψ† on an initial time slice to determine the full evolution. To quantize the theory, we promote the ﬁeld ψ and its momentum ψ† to operators, satisfying the canonical commutation relations, which read [ψα(⃗x), ψβ(⃗y)] = [ψ† α(⃗x), ψ† β(⃗y)] = 0 [ψα(⃗x), ψ† β(⃗y)] = δαβ δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (5.3) It’s this step that we’ll soon have to reconsider. Since we’re dealing with a free theory, where any classical solution is a sum of plane waves, we may write the quantum operators as 2 X Z d3p (2π)3 1 p h bs ⃗p us(⃗p)e+i⃗p·⃗x + cs † ⃗p vs(⃗p)e−i⃗p·⃗xi\n\nψ(⃗x) = 2E⃗p s=1 2 X Z d3p (2π)3 1 p h bs † ⃗p us(⃗p)†e−i⃗p·⃗x + cs ⃗p vs(⃗p)†e+i⃗p·⃗xi (5.4)\n\nψ†(⃗x) = 2E⃗p s=1 where the operators bs † ⃗p create particles associated to the spinors us(⃗p), while cs † ⃗p create particles associated to vs(⃗p). As with the scalars, the commutation relations of the ﬁelds imply commutation relations for the annihilation and creation operators\n\n– 106 – Claim: The ﬁeld commutation relations (5.3) are equivalent to [br ⃗p, bs † ⃗q ] = (2π)3δrs δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) [cr ⃗p, cs † ⃗q ] = −(2π)3δrs δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (5.5) with all other commutators vanishing. Note the strange minus sign in the [c, c†] term. It’s not yet obvious that it’s bad, but we should be aware of it. For now, let’s just carry on. Proof: Let’s show that the [b, b†] and [c, c†] commutators reproduce the ﬁeld commutators (5.3), Z d3p d3q (2π)6 1 p\n\n\u0010 [br ⃗p, bs † ⃗q ]ur(⃗p)us(⃗q)†ei(⃗x·⃗p−⃗y·⃗q) [ψ(⃗x), ψ†(⃗y)] = X 4E⃗pE⃗q r,s\n\n+ [cr † ⃗p , cs ⃗q]vr(⃗p)vs(⃗q)†e−i(⃗x·⃗p−⃗y·⃗q)\u0011 Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p\n\n\u0000 us(⃗p)¯us(⃗p)γ0ei⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y) + vs(⃗p)¯vs(⃗p)γ0e−i⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y)\u0001 (5.6)\n\n= X s At this stage we use the outer product formulae (4.128) and (4.129) which tell us P s us(⃗p)¯us(⃗p) = /p + m and P s vs(⃗p)¯vs(⃗p) = /p −m, so that [ψ(⃗x), ψ†(⃗y)] = Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p\n\n\u0000 ( /p + m)γ0ei⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y) + ( /p −m)γ0e−i⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y)\u0001\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p\n\n\u0000 (p0γ0 + piγi + m)γ0 + (p0γ0 −piγi −m)γ0\u0001 e+i⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y) where, in the second term, we’ve changed ⃗p →−⃗p under the integration sign. Now, using p0 = E⃗p we have [ψ(⃗x), ψ†(⃗y)] = Z d3p (2π)3e+i⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y) = δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (5.7) as promised. Notice that it’s a little tricky in the middle there, making sure that the piγi terms cancel. This was the reason we needed the minus sign in the [c, c†] commutator terms in (5.5). □ 5.1.1 The Hamiltonian To proceed, let’s construct the Hamiltonian for the theory. Using the momentum π = iψ†, we have H = π ˙ψ −L = ¯ψ(−iγi∂i + m)ψ (5.8)\n\n– 107 – which means that H = R d3x H agrees with the conserved energy computed using Noether’s theorem (4.92). We now wish to turn the Hamiltonian into an operator. Let’s ﬁrstly look at (−iγi∂i + m)ψ = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p h bs ⃗p (−γipi + m)us(⃗p) e+i⃗p·⃗x + cs † ⃗p (γipi + m)vs(⃗p) e−i⃗p·⃗xi 2E⃗p where, for once we’ve left the sum over s = 1, 2 implicit. There’s a small subtlety with the minus signs in deriving this equation that arises from the use of the Minkowski metric in contracting indices, so that ⃗p · ⃗x ≡P i xipi = −xipi. Now we use the deﬁning equations for the spinors us(⃗p) and vs(⃗p) given in (4.105) and (4.111), to replace (−γipi + m)us(⃗p) = γ0p0us(⃗p) and (γipi + m)vs(⃗p) = −γ0p0vs(⃗p) (5.9) so we can write r (−iγi∂i + m)ψ = Z d3p (2π)3 E⃗p 2 γ0 h bs ⃗p us(⃗p) e+i⃗p·⃗x −cs † ⃗p vs(⃗p) e−i⃗p·⃗xi (5.10) We now use this to write the operator Hamiltonian H = Z d3x ψ†γ0(−iγi∂i + m)ψ\n\n= Z d3x d3p d3q s E⃗p 4E⃗q h br † ⃗q ur(⃗q)†e−i⃗q·⃗x + cr ⃗q vr(⃗q)† e+i⃗q·⃗xi · (2π)6 h bs ⃗p us(⃗p)e+i⃗p·⃗x −cs † ⃗p vs(⃗p) e−i⃗p·⃗xi\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2 h br † ⃗p bs ⃗p[ur(⃗p)† · us(⃗p)] −cr ⃗pcs † ⃗p [vr(⃗p)† · vs(⃗p)]\n\n−br † ⃗p cs † −⃗p[ur(⃗p)† · vs(−⃗p)] + cr ⃗p bs −⃗p[vr(⃗p)† · us(−⃗p)] i where, in the last two terms we have relabelled ⃗p →−⃗p. We now use our inner product formulae (4.122), (4.124) and (4.127) which read ur(⃗p)† · us(⃗p) = vr(⃗p)† · vs(⃗p) = 2p0δrs and ur(⃗p)† · vs(−⃗p) = vr(⃗p)† · us(−⃗p) = 0 giving us H = Z d3p (2π)3E⃗p \u0010 bs † ⃗p bs ⃗p −cs ⃗pcs † ⃗p \u0011 (5.11)\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3E⃗p \u0010 bs † ⃗p bs ⃗p −cs † ⃗p cs ⃗p + (2π)3δ(3)(0) \u0011 (5.12)\n\n– 108 – The δ(3) term is familiar and easily dealt with by normal ordering. However the −c†c term is a disaster! The Hamiltonian is not bounded below, meaning that our quantum theory makes no sense. Taken seriously it would tell us that we could tumble to states of lower and lower energy by continually producing c† particles. As the English would say, it’s all gone a bit Pete Tong. (No relation). Since the above calculation was a little tricky, you might think that it’s possible to rescue the theory to get the minus signs to work out right. You can play around with diﬀerent things, but you’ll always ﬁnd this minus sign cropping up somewhere. And, in fact, it’s telling us something important that we missed. 5.2 Fermionic Quantization The key piece of physics that we missed is that spin 1/2 particles are fermions, meaning that they obey Fermi-Dirac statistics with the quantum state picking up a minus sign upon the interchange of any two particles. This fact is embedded into the structure of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory: the spin-statistics theorem says that integer spin ﬁelds must be quantized as bosons, while half-integer spin ﬁelds must be quantized as fermions. Any attempt to do otherwise will lead to an inconsistency, such as the unbounded Hamiltonian we saw in (5.12). So how do we go about quantizing a ﬁeld as a fermion? Recall that when we quantized the scalar ﬁeld, the resulting particles obeyed bosonic statistics because the creation and annihilation operators satisﬁed the commutation relations, [a† ⃗p, a† ⃗q] = 0 ⇒ a† ⃗pa† ⃗q |0⟩≡|⃗p, ⃗q⟩= |⃗q, ⃗p⟩ (5.13) To have states obeying fermionic statistics, we need anti-commutation relations, {A, B} ≡ AB + BA. Rather than (5.3), we will ask that the spinor ﬁelds satisfy\n\n{ψα(⃗x), ψβ(⃗y)} = {ψ† α(⃗x), ψ† β(⃗y)} = 0\n\n{ψα(⃗x), ψ† β(⃗y)} = δαβ δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (5.14) We still have the expansion (5.4) of ψ and ψ† in terms of b, b†, c and c†. But now the same proof that led us to (5.5) tells us that\n\n{br ⃗p, bs † ⃗q } = (2π)3δrs δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q)\n\n{cr ⃗p, cs † ⃗q } = (2π)3δrs δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (5.15) with all other anti-commutators vanishing,\n\n{br ⃗p, bs ⃗q} = {cr ⃗p, cs ⃗q} = {br ⃗p, cs † ⃗q } = {br ⃗p, cs ⃗q} = . . . = 0 (5.16)\n\n– 109 – The calculation of the Hamiltonian proceeds as before, all the way through to the penultimate line (5.11). At that stage, we get H = Z d3p (2π)3 E⃗p h bs † ⃗p bs ⃗p −cs ⃗pcs † ⃗p i\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 E⃗p h bs † ⃗p bs ⃗p + cs † ⃗p cs ⃗p −(2π)3δ(3)(0) i (5.17) The anti-commutators have saved us from the indignity of an unbounded Hamiltonian. Note that when normal ordering the Hamiltonian we now throw away a negative contribution −(2π)3δ(3)(0). In principle, this could partially cancel the positive contribution from bosonic ﬁelds. Cosmological constant problem anyone?!\n\n5.2.1 Fermi-Dirac Statistics Just as in the bosonic case, we deﬁne the vacuum |0⟩to satisfy, bs ⃗p |0⟩= cs ⃗p |0⟩= 0 (5.18) Although b and c obey anti-commutation relations, the Hamiltonian (5.17) has nice commutation relations with them. You can check that [H, br ⃗p] = −E⃗p br ⃗p and [H, br † ⃗p ] = E⃗p br † ⃗p [H, cr ⃗p] = −E⃗p cr ⃗p and [H, cr † ⃗p ] = E⃗p cr † ⃗p (5.19) This means that we can again construct a tower of energy eigenstates by acting on the vacuum by br † ⃗p and cr,† ⃗p to create particles and antiparticles, just as in the bosonic case. For example, we have the one-particle states\n\n|⃗p, r⟩= br † ⃗p |0⟩ (5.20) The two particle states now satisfy\n\n|⃗p1, r1; ⃗p2, r2⟩≡br1 † ⃗p1 br2 † ⃗p2 |0⟩= −|⃗p2, r2; ⃗p1, r1⟩ (5.21) conﬁrming that the particles do indeed obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. In particular, we have the Pauli-Exclusion principle |⃗p, r; ⃗p, r⟩= 0. Finally, if we wanted to be sure about the spin of the particle, we could act with the angular momentum operator (4.96) to conﬁrm that a stationary particle |⃗p = 0, r⟩does indeed carry intrinsic angular momentum 1/2 as expected. 5.3 Dirac’s Hole Interpretation “In this attempt, the success seems to have been on the side of Dirac rather than logic” Pauli on Dirac\n\n– 110 – Let’s pause our discussion to make a small historical detour. Dirac originally viewed his equation as a relativistic version of the Schr¨odinger equation, with ψ interpreted as the wavefunction for a single particle with spin. To reinforce this interpretation, he wrote (i /∂−m)ψ = 0 as i∂ψ\n\n∂t = −i⃗α · ⃗∇ψ + mβψ ≡ˆHψ (5.22) where ⃗α = −γ0⃗γ and β = γ0. Here the operator ˆH is interpreted as the one-particle Hamiltonian. This is a very diﬀerent viewpoint from the one we now have, where ψ is a classical ﬁeld that should be quantized. In Dirac’s view, the Hamiltonian of the system is ˆH deﬁned above, while for us the Hamiltonian is the ﬁeld operator (5.17). Let’s see where Dirac’s viewpoint leads. With the interpretation of ψ as a single-particle wavefunction, the plane-wave solutions (4.104) and (4.110) to the Dirac equation are thought of as energy eigenstates, with\n\nψ = u(⃗p) e−ip·x ⇒ i∂ψ\n\n∂t = E⃗p ψ\n\nψ = v(⃗p) e+ip·x ⇒ i∂ψ\n\n∂t = −E⃗p ψ (5.23) which look like positive and negative energy solutions. The spectrum is once again unbounded below; there are states v(⃗p) with arbitrarily low energy −E⃗p. At ﬁrst glance this is disastrous, just like the unbounded ﬁeld theory Hamiltonian (5.12). Dirac postulated an ingenious solution to this problem: since the electrons are fermions (a fact which is put in by hand to Dirac’s theory) they obey the Pauli-exclusion principle. So we could simply stipulate that in the true vacuum of the universe, all the negative energy states are ﬁlled. Only the positive energy states are accessible. These ﬁlled negative energy states are referred to as the Dirac sea. Although you might worry about the inﬁnite negative charge of the vacuum, Dirac argued that only charge diﬀerences would be observable (a trick reminiscent of the normal ordering prescription we used for ﬁeld operators). Having avoided disaster by ﬂoating on an inﬁnite sea comprised of occupied negative energy states, Dirac realized that his theory made a shocking prediction. Suppose that a negative energy state is excited to a positive energy state, leaving behind a hole. The hole would have all the properties of the electron, except it would carry positive charge. After ﬂirting with the idea that it may be the proton, Dirac ﬁnally concluded that the hole is a new particle: the positron. Moreover, when a positron comes across\n\n– 111 – an electron, the two can annihilate. Dirac had predicted anti-matter, one of the greatest achievements of theoretical physics. It took only a couple of years before the positron was discovered experimentally in 1932. Although Dirac’s physical insight led him to the right answer, we now understand that the interpretation of the Dirac spinor as a single-particle wavefunction is not really correct. For example, Dirac’s argument for anti-matter relies crucially on the particles being fermions while, as we have seen already in this course, anti-particles exist for both fermions and bosons. What we really learn from Dirac’s analysis is that there is no consistent way to interpret the Dirac equation as describing a single particle. It is instead to be thought of as a classical ﬁeld which has only positive energy solutions because the Hamiltonian (4.92) is positive deﬁnite. Quantization of this ﬁeld then gives rise to both particle and anti-particle excitations. This from Julian Schwinger: “Until now, everyone thought that the Dirac equation referred directly to physical particles. Now, in ﬁeld theory, we recognize that the equations refer to a sublevel. Experimentally we are concerned with particles, yet the old equations describe ﬁelds.... When you begin with ﬁeld equations, you operate on a level where the particles are not there from the start. It is when you solve the ﬁeld equations that you see the emergence of particles.” 5.4 Propagators Let’s now move to the Heisenberg picture. We deﬁne the spinors ψ(⃗x, t) at every point in spacetime such that they satisfy the operator equation\n\n∂ψ\n\n∂t = i[H, ψ] (5.24) We solve this by the expansion 2 X Z d3p (2π)3 1 p h bs ⃗pus(⃗p)e−ip·x + cs † ⃗p vs(⃗p)e+ip·xi\n\nψ(x) = 2E⃗p s=1 2 X Z d3p (2π)3 1 p h bs † ⃗p us(⃗p)†e+ip·x + cs ⃗pvs(⃗p)†e−ip·xi (5.25)\n\nψ†(x) = 2E⃗p s=1 Let’s now look at the anti-commutators of these ﬁelds. We deﬁne the fermionic propagator to be iSαβ = {ψα(x), ¯ψβ(y)} (5.26)\n\n– 112 – In what follows we will often drop the indices and simply write iS(x−y) = {ψ(x), ¯ψ(y)}, but you should remember that S(x−y) is a 4×4 matrix. Inserting the expansion (5.25), we have iS(x −y) = Z d3p d3q (2π)6 1 p h {bs ⃗p, br † ⃗q }us(⃗p)¯ur(⃗q)e−i(p·x−q·y) 4E⃗pE⃗q\n\n+{cs † ⃗p , cr ⃗q}vs(⃗p)¯vr(⃗q)e+i(p·x−q·y)i\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p\n\n\u0002 us(⃗p)¯us(⃗p)e−ip·(x−y) + vs(⃗p)¯vs(⃗p)e+ip·(x−y)\u0003\n\n= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p\n\n\u0002 ( /p + m)e−ip·(x−y) + ( /p −m)e+ip·(x−y)\u0003 (5.27) where to reach the ﬁnal line we have used the outer product formulae (4.128) and (4.129). We can then write iS(x −y) = (i /∂x + m)(D(x −y) −D(y −x)) (5.28) in terms of the propagator for a real scalar ﬁeld D(x −y) which, recall, can be written as (2.90) D(x −y) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p e−ip·(x−y) (5.29) Some comments:\n\n• For spacelike separated points (x−y)2 < 0, we have already seen that D(x−y)− D(y −x) = 0. In the bosonic theory, we made a big deal of this since it ensured that [φ(x), φ(y)] = 0 (x −y)2 < 0 (5.30) outside the lightcone, which we trumpeted as proof that our theory was causal. However, for fermions we now have\n\n{ψα(x), ψβ(y)} = 0 (x −y)2 < 0 (5.31) outside the lightcone. What happened to our precious causality? The best that we can say is that all our observables are bilinear in fermions, for example the Hamiltonian (5.17). These still commute outside the lightcone. The theory remains causal as long as fermionic operators are not observable. If you think this is a little weak, remember that no one has ever seen a physical measuring apparatus come back to minus itself when you rotate by 360 degrees!\n\n– 113 –\n\n• At least away from singularities, the propagator satisﬁes (i /∂x −m)S(x −y) = 0 (5.32) which follows from the fact that ( /∂ 2 x + m2)D(x −y) = 0 using the mass shell condition p2 = m2. 5.5 The Feynman Propagator By a similar calculation to that above, we can determine the vacuum expectation value,\n\n⟨0| ψα(x) ¯ψβ(y) |0⟩= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p ( /p + m)αβ e−ip·(x−y)\n\n⟨0| ¯ψβ(y)ψα(x) |0⟩= Z d3p (2π)3 1 2E⃗p ( /p −m)αβ e+ip·(x−y) (5.33) We now deﬁne the Feynman propagator SF(x −y), which is again a 4 × 4 matrix, as the time ordered product, ( ⟨0| ψ(x) ¯ψ(y) |0⟩ x0 > y0 SF(x −y) = ⟨0| Tψ(x) ¯ψ(y) |0⟩≡\n\n⟨0| −¯ψ(y)ψ(x) |0⟩ y0 > x0 (5.34) Notice the minus sign! It is necessary for Lorentz invariance. When (x−y)2 < 0, there is no invariant way to determine whether x0 > y0 or y0 > x0. In this case the minus sign is necessary to make the two deﬁnitions agree since {ψ(x), ¯ψ(y)} = 0 outside the lightcone. We have the 4-momentum integral representation for the Feynman propagator, SF(x −y) = i Z d4p (2π)4 e−ip·(x−y) γ · p + m p2 −m2 + iϵ (5.35) which satisﬁes (i /∂x −m)SF(x −y) = iδ(4)(x −y), so that SF is a Green’s function for the Dirac operator. The minus sign that we see in (5.34) also occurs for any string of operators inside a time ordered product T(. . .). While bosonic operators commute inside T, fermionic operators anti-commute. We have this same behaviour for normal ordered products as well, with fermionic operators obeying : ψ1ψ2 := −: ψ2ψ1 :. With the understanding that all fermionic operators anti-commute inside T and ::, Wick’s theorem proceeds just as in the bosonic case. We deﬁne the contraction z }| { ψ(x) ¯ψ(y) = T(ψ(x) ¯ψ(y)) −: ψ(x) ¯ψ(y) : = SF(x −y) (5.36)\n\n– 114 – 5.6 Yukawa Theory The interaction between a Dirac fermion of mass m and a real scalar ﬁeld of mass µ is governed by the Yukawa theory, 2µ2φ2 + ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ −m)ψ −λφ ¯ψψ (5.37) 2∂µφ∂µφ −1 L = 1 which is the proper version of the baby scalar Yukawa theory we looked at in Section 3. Couplings of this type appear in the standard model, between fermions and the Higgs boson. In that context, the fermions can be leptons (such as the electron) or quarks. Yukawa originally proposed an interaction of this type as an eﬀective theory of nuclear forces. With an eye to this, we will again refer to the φ particles as mesons, and the ψ particles as nucleons. Except, this time, the nucleons have spin. (This is still not a particularly realistic theory of nucleon interactions, not least because we’re omitting isospin. Moreover, in Nature the relevant mesons are pions which are pseudoscalars, so a coupling of the form φ ¯ψγ5ψ would be more appropriate. We’ll turn to this brieﬂy in Section 5.7.3). Note the dimensions of the various ﬁelds. We still have [φ] = 1, but the kinetic terms require that [ψ] = 3/2. Thus, unlike in the case with only scalars, the coupling is dimensionless: [λ] = 0. We’ll proceed as we did in Section 3, ﬁrstly computing the amplitude of a particular scattering process then, with that calculation as a guide, writing down the Feynman rules for the theory. We start with: 5.6.1 An Example: Putting Spin on Nucleon Scattering Let’s study ψψ →ψψ scattering. This is the same calculation we performed in Section (3.3.3) except now the fermions have spin. Our initial and ﬁnal states are 4E⃗pE⃗q bs † ⃗p br † ⃗q |0⟩≡|⃗p, s; ⃗q, r⟩\n\n|i⟩= p 4E⃗p′E⃗q′ bs′ † ⃗p ′ br′ † ⃗q ′ |0⟩≡|⃗p ′, s′; ⃗q ′, r′⟩ (5.38)\n\n|f⟩= p We need to be a little cautious about minus signs, because the b†’s now anti-commute. In particular, we should be careful when we take the adjoint. We have 4E⃗p′E⃗q′ ⟨0| br′ ⃗q ′ bs′ ⃗p ′ (5.39)\n\n⟨f| = p We want to calculate the order λ2 terms from the S-matrix element ⟨f| S −1 |i⟩. Z d4x1d4x2 T \u0000 ¯ψ(x1)ψ(x1)φ(x1) ¯ψ(x2)ψ(x2)φ(x2) \u0001 (5.40) (−iλ)2 2\n\n– 115 – where, as usual, all ﬁelds are in the interaction picture. Just as in the bosonic calculation, the contribution to nucleon scattering comes from the contraction\n\n: ¯ψ(x1)ψ(x1) ¯ψ(x2)ψ(x2) : z }| { φ(x1)φ(x2) (5.41) We just have to be careful about how the spinor indices are contracted. Let’s start by looking at how the fermionic operators act on |i⟩. We expand out the ψ ﬁelds, leaving the ¯ψ ﬁelds alone for now. We may ignore the c† pieces in ψ since they give no contribution at order λ2. We have\n\n: ¯ψ(x1)ψ(x1) ¯ψ(x2)ψ(x2) : bs † ⃗p br † ⃗q |0⟩= − Z d3k1 d3k2 (2π)6 [ ¯ψ(x1) · um(⃗k1)] [ ¯ψ(x2) · un(⃗k2)] e−ik1·x1−ik2·x2 p4E⃗k1E⃗k2 bm ⃗k1bn ⃗k2bs † ⃗p br † ⃗q |0⟩ (5.42) where we’ve used square brackets [·] to show how the spinor indices are contracted. The minus sign that sits out front came from moving ψ(x1) past ¯ψ(x2). Now anti-commuting the b’s past the b†’s, we get\n\n= −1 2 p\n\n\u0000 [ ¯ψ(x1) · ur(⃗q)] [ ¯ψ(x2) · us(⃗p)]e−ip·x2−iq·x1 E⃗pE⃗q\n\n−[ ¯ψ(x1) · us(⃗p)] [ ¯ψ(x2) · ur(⃗q)]e−ip·x1−iq·x2\u0001 |0⟩ (5.43) Note, in particular, the relative minus sign that appears between these two terms. Now let’s see what happens when we hit this with ⟨f|. We look at\n\n⟨0| br′ ⃗q′ bs′ ⃗p′ [ ¯ψ(x1) · ur(⃗q)] [ ¯ψ(x2) · us(⃗p)] |0⟩= e+ip′·x1+iq′·x2 E⃗p′E⃗q′ [¯us′(⃗p ′) · ur(⃗q)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · us(⃗p)] 2 p\n\n−e+ip′·x2+iq′·x1 E⃗p′E⃗q′ [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · ur(⃗q)] [¯us′(⃗p ′) · us(⃗p)] 2 p The [ ¯ψ(x1) · us(⃗p)] [ ¯ψ(x2) · ur(⃗q)] term in (5.43) doubles up with this, cancelling the factor of 1/2 in front of (5.40). Meanwhile, the 1/ √ E terms cancel the relativistic state normalization. Putting everything together, we have the following expression for ⟨f| S −1 |i⟩ (−iλ)2 Z d4x1d4x2d4k (2π)4 ieik·(x1−x2)\n\n\u0010 [¯us′(⃗p ′) · us(⃗p)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · ur(⃗q)]e+ix1·(q′−q)+ix2·(p′−p) k2 −µ2 + iϵ\n\n−[¯us′(⃗p ′) · ur(⃗q)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · us(⃗p)]eix1·(p′−q)+ix2·(q′−p)\u0011\n\n– 116 – where we’ve put the φ propagator back in. Performing the integrals over x1 and x2, this becomes, Z d4k(2π)4i(−iλ)2\n\n\u0010 [¯us′(⃗p ′) · us(⃗p)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · ur(⃗q)]δ(4)(q′ −q + k)δ(4)(p′ −p −k) k2 −µ2 + iϵ\n\n−[¯us′(⃗p ′) · ur(⃗q)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · us(⃗p)]δ(4)(p′ −q + k)δ(4)(q′ −p −k) \u0011 And we’re almost there! Finally, writing the S-matrix element in terms of the amplitude in the usual way, ⟨f| S −1 |i⟩= iA(2π)4δ(4)(p + q −p′ −q′), we have A = (−iλ)2 \u0012[¯us′(⃗p ′) · us(⃗p)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · ur(⃗q)] (p′ −p)2 −µ2 + iϵ −[¯us′(⃗p ′) · ur(⃗q)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · us(⃗p)]\n\n\u0013 (q′ −p)2 −µ2 + iϵ which is our ﬁnal answer for the amplitude. 5.7 Feynman Rules for Fermions It’s important to bear in mind that the calculation we just did kind of blows. Thankfully the Feynman rules will once again encapsulate the combinatoric complexities and make life easier for us. The rules to compute amplitudes are the following\n\n• To each incoming fermion with momentum p and spin r, we associate a spinor ur(⃗p). For outgoing fermions we associate ¯ur(⃗p). u (p) r p p u (p) r Figure 21: An incoming fermion Figure 22: An outgoing fermion\n\n• To each incoming anti-fermion with momentum p and spin r, we associate a spinor ¯vr(⃗p). For outgoing anti-fermions we associate vr(⃗p). p p v (p) r rv (p) Figure 23: An incoming anti-fermion Figure 24: An outgoing anti-fermion\n\n• Each vertex gets a factor of −iλ.\n\n– 117 –\n\n• Each internal line gets a factor of the relevant propagator. p i p2 −µ2 + iϵ for scalars p i( /p + m) p2 −m2 + iϵ for fermions (5.44) The arrows on the fermion lines must ﬂow consistently through the diagram (this ensures fermion number conservation). Note that the fermionic propagator is a 4×4 matrix. The matrix indices are contracted at each vertex, either with further propagators, or with external spinors u, ¯u, v or ¯v.\n\n• Impose momentum conservation at each vertex, and integrate over undetermined loop momenta.\n\n• Add extra minus signs for statistics. Some examples will be given below. 5.7.1 Examples Let’s run through the same examples we did for the scalar Yukawa theory. Firstly, we have Nucleon Scattering For the example we worked out previously, the two lowest order Feynman diagrams are shown in Figure 25. We’ve drawn the second Feynman diagram with the legs crossed p,s p,s\n\n/ p,s /\n\n/ p,s / q,r / / + q,r / / q,r q,r Figure 25: The two Feynman diagrams for nucleon scattering to emphasize the fact that it picks up a minus sign due to statistics. (Note that the way the legs point in the Feynman diagram doesn’t tell us the direction in which the particles leave the scattering event: the momentum label does that. The two diagrams above are diﬀerent because the incoming legs are attached to diﬀerent outgoing legs). Using the Feynman rules we can read oﬀthe amplitude. A = (−iλ)2 \u0012[¯us′(⃗p ′) · us(⃗p)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · ur(⃗q)] (p −p′)2 −µ2 −[¯us′(⃗p ′) · ur(⃗q)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′) · us(⃗p)]\n\n\u0013 (5.45) (p −q′)2 −µ2\n\n– 118 – The denominators in each term are due to the meson propagator, with the momentum determined by conservation at each vertex. This agrees with the amplitude we computed earlier using Wick’s theorem. Nucleon to Meson Scattering Let’s now look at ψ ¯ψ →φφ. The two lowest order Feynman diagrams are shown in Figure 26. p,s p,s\n\n/ p,s /\n\n/ p,s / q,r / / + q,r / / q,r q,r Figure 26: The two Feynman diagrams for nucleon to meson scattering Applying the Feynman rules, we have A = (−iλ)2 \u0012¯vr(⃗q)[γµ(pµ −p′ µ) + m]us(⃗p) (p −p′)2 −m2 + ¯vr(⃗q)[γµ(pµ −q′ µ) + m]us(⃗p) (p −q′)2 −m2\n\n\u0013 Since the internal line is now a fermion, the propagator contains γµ(pµ−p′ µ)+m factors. This is a 4 × 4 matrix which sits on the top, sandwiched between the two external spinors. Now the exchange statistics applies to the ﬁnal meson states. These are bosons and, correspondingly, there is no relative minus sign between the two diagrams. Nucleon-Anti-Nucleon Scattering For ψ ¯ψ →ψ ¯ψ, the two lowest order Feynman diagrams are of two distinct types, just like in the bosonic case. They are shown in Figure 27. The corresponding amplitude is given by, A = (−iλ)2 \u0012 −[¯us′(⃗p ′) · us(⃗p)] [¯vr(⃗q) · vr′(⃗q ′)] (p −p′)2 −µ2 + [¯vr(⃗q) · us(⃗p)] [¯us′(⃗p ′) · vr′(⃗q ′)]\n\n\u0013 (5.46) (p + q)2 −µ2 + iϵ As in the bosonic diagrams, there is again the diﬀerence in the momentum dependence in the denominator. But now the diﬀerence in the diagrams is also reﬂected in the spinor contractions in the numerator.\n\n– 119 – p,s p,s\n\n/ p,s /\n\n/ p,s /\n\n+ q,r / / q,r q,r / / q,r Figure 27: The two Feynman diagrams for nucleon-anti-nucleon scattering More subtle are the minus signs. The fermionic statistics mean that the ﬁrst diagram has an extra minus sign relative to the ψψ scattering of Figure 25. Since this minus sign will be important when we come to ﬁgure out whether the Yukawa force is attractive or repulsive, let’s go back to basics and see where it comes from. The initial and ﬁnal states for this scattering process are 4E⃗pE⃗q bs † ⃗p cr † ⃗q |0⟩≡|⃗p, s; ⃗q, r⟩\n\n|i⟩= p 4E⃗p′E⃗q′ bs′ † ⃗p ′ cr′ † ⃗q ′ |0⟩≡|⃗p ′, s′; ⃗q ′, r′⟩ (5.47)\n\n|f⟩= p The ordering of b† and c† in these states is crucial and reﬂects the scattering ψ ¯ψ →ψ ¯ψ, as opposed to ψ ¯ψ →¯ψψ which would diﬀer by a minus sign. The ﬁrst diagram in Figure 27 comes from the term in the perturbative expansion,\n\n⟨f| : ¯ψ(x1)ψ(x1) ¯ψ(x2)ψ(x2) : bs † ⃗p cr † ⃗q |0⟩∼⟨f| [¯vm(⃗k1) · ψ(x1)] [ ¯ψ(x2) · un(⃗k2)]cm ⃗k1bn ⃗k2bs † ⃗p cr † ⃗q |0⟩ where we’ve neglected a bunch of objects in this equation like R d4ki and exponential factors because we only want to keep track of the minus signs. Moving the annihilation operators past the creation operators, we have\n\n+ ⟨f| [¯vr(⃗q) · ψ(x1)] [ ¯ψ(x2) · us(⃗p)] |0⟩ (5.48) Repeating the process by expanding out the ψ(x1) and ¯ψ(x2) ﬁelds and moving them to the left to annihilate ⟨f|, we have\n\n⟨0| cr′ ⃗q ′bs′ ⃗p ′cm † ⃗l1 bn † ⃗l2 [¯vr(⃗q) · vm(⃗l1)] [¯un(⃗l2) · us(⃗p)] |0⟩∼−[¯vr(⃗q) · vr′(⃗q ′)] [¯us′(⃗p ′) · us(⃗p)] where the minus sign has appeared from anti-commuting cm † ⃗l1 past bs′ ⃗p ′. This is the overall minus sign found in (5.46). One can also follow similar contractions to compute the second diagram in Figure 27.\n\n– 120 – Meson Scattering Finally, we can also compute the scattering of φφ →φφ 1p which, as in the bosonic case, picks up its leading contribution at one-loop. The amplitude for the diagram shown in the ﬁgure is p1 / p / 2 p2 iA = −(−iλ)4 Z d4k (2π)4 Tr /k + m (k2 −m2 + iϵ) /k + /p ′ 1 + m ((k + p′ 1)2 −m2 + iϵ) Figure 28:\n\n× /k + /p ′ 1 −/p1 + m ((k + p ′ 1 −p1)2 −m2 + iϵ) /k −/p ′ 2 + m ((k −p ′ 2)2 −m2 + iϵ) Notice that the high momentum limit of the integral is R d4k/k4, which is no longer ﬁnite, but diverges logarithmically. You will have to wait until next term to make sense of this integral. There’s an overall minus sign sitting in front of this amplitude. This is a generic feature of diagrams with fermions running in loops: each fermionic loop in a diagram gives rise to an extra minus sign. We can see this rather simply in the diagram which involves the expression z }| { ¯ψα(x) z }| { ψα(x) ¯ψβ(y) ψβ(y) = − z }| { ψβ(y) ¯ψα(x) z }| { ψα(x) ¯ψβ(y)\n\n= −Tr (SF(y −x)SF(x −y)) After passing the fermion ﬁelds through each other, a minus sign appears, sitting in front of the two propagators. 5.7.2 The Yukawa Potential Revisited We saw in Section 3.5.2, that the exchange of a real scalar particle gives rise to a universally attractive Yukawa potential between two spin zero particles. Does the same hold for the spin 1/2 particles?\n\n– 121 – Recall that the strategy to compute the potential is to take the non-relativistic limit of the scattering amplitude, and compare with the analogous result from quantum mechanics. Our new amplitude now also includes the spinor degrees of freedom u(⃗p) and v(⃗p). In the non-relativistic limit, p →(m, ⃗p), and\n\n√p · σξ √p · ¯σξ\n\n!\n\nξ\n\n!\n\n→√m u(⃗p) =\n\nξ\n\n√p · σξ\n\nξ\n\n!\n\n!\n\n→√m (5.49) v(⃗p) =\n\n−√p · ¯σξ\n\n−ξ In this limit, the spinor contractions in the amplitude for ψψ →ψψ scattering (5.45) become ¯us′ · us = 2mδss′ and the amplitude is p,s (⃗p −⃗p′) + µ2 − δs′rδr′s\n\n= −i(−iλ)2 (2m) \u0012 δs′sδr′r\n\n/ p,s /\n\n\u0013 (5.50) (⃗p −⃗q′) + µ2 q,r / / q,r The δ symbols tell us that spin is conserved in the non-relativistic limit, while the momentum dependence is the same as in the bosonic case, telling us that once again the particles feel an attractive Yukawa potential, U(⃗r) = −λ2e−µr 4πr (5.51) Repeating the calculation for ψ ¯ψ →ψ ¯ψ, there are two minus signs which cancel each other. The ﬁrst is the extra overall minus sign in the scattering amplitude (5.46), due to the fermionic nature of the particles. The second minus sign comes from the non-relativistic limit of the spinor contraction for anti-particles in (5.46), which is ¯vs′ · vs = −2mδss′. These two signs cancel, giving us once again an attractive Yukawa potential (5.51). 5.7.3 Pseudo-Scalar Coupling Rather than the standard Yukawa coupling, we could instead consider LYuk = −λφ ¯ψγ5ψ (5.52) This still preserves parity if φ is a pseudoscalar, i.e. P : φ(⃗x, t) →−φ(−⃗x, t) (5.53)\n\n– 122 – We can compute in this theory very simply: the Feynman rule for the interaction vertex is now changed to a factor of −iλγ5. For example, the Feynman diagrams for ψψ →ψψ scattering are again given by Figure 25, with the amplitude now A = (−iλ)2 \u0012[¯us′(⃗p ′)γ5us(⃗p)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′)γ5ur(⃗q)] (p −p′)2 −µ2 −[¯us′(⃗p ′)γ5ur(⃗q)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′)γ5us(⃗p)]\n\n\u0013 (p −q′)2 −µ2 We could again try to take the non-relativistic limit for this amplitude. But this time, things work a little diﬀerently. Using the expressions for the spinors (5.49), we have ¯us′γ5us →0 in the non-relativistic limit. To ﬁnd the non-relativistic amplitude, we must go to next to leading order. One can easily check that ¯us′(⃗p ′)γ5us(⃗p) → m ξs′ T(⃗p−⃗p ′)·⃗σξs. So, in the non-relativistic limit, the leading order amplitude arising from pseudoscalar exchange is given by a spin-spin coupling, p,s\n\n→+im(−iλ)2 [ξs′ T(⃗p −⃗p ′) · ⃗σξs] [ξr′ T(⃗p −⃗p ′) · ⃗σξr]\n\n/ p,s / (⃗p −⃗p ′)2 + µ2 (5.54) q,r / / q,r\n\n– 123 – 6. Quantum Electrodynamics In this section we ﬁnally get to quantum electrodynamics (QED), the theory of light interacting with charged matter. Our path to quantization will be as before: we start with the free theory of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and see how the quantum theory gives rise to a photon with two polarization states. We then describe how to couple the photon to fermions and to bosons. 6.1 Maxwell’s Equations The Lagrangian for Maxwell’s equations in the absence of any sources is simply L = −1 4 FµνF µν (6.1) where the ﬁeld strength is deﬁned by Fµν = ∂µAν −∂νAµ (6.2) The equations of motion which follow from this Lagrangian are\n\n\u0013 = −∂µF µν = 0 (6.3)\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µAν)\n\n∂µ Meanwhile, from the deﬁnition of Fµν, the ﬁeld strength also satisﬁes the Bianchi identity\n\n∂λFµν + ∂µFνλ + ∂νFλµ = 0 (6.4) To make contact with the form of Maxwell’s equations you learn about in high school, we need some 3-vector notation. If we deﬁne Aµ = (φ, ⃗A), then the electric ﬁeld ⃗E and magnetic ﬁeld ⃗B are deﬁned by\n\n⃗E = −∇φ −∂⃗A\n\n∂t and ⃗B = ∇× ⃗A (6.5) which, in terms of Fµν, becomes 0 Ex Ey Ez −Ex 0 −Bz By −Ey Bz 0 −Bx −Ez −By Bx 0\n\n!\n\nFµν = (6.6) The Bianchi identity (6.4) then gives two of Maxwell’s equations,\n\n∇· ⃗B = 0 and ∂⃗B\n\n∂t = −∇× ⃗E (6.7)\n\n– 124 – These remain true even in the presence of electric sources. Meanwhile, the equations of motion give the remaining two Maxwell equations,\n\n∇· ⃗E = 0 and ∂⃗E\n\n∂t = ∇× ⃗B (6.8) As we will see shortly, in the presence of charged matter these equations pick up extra terms on the right-hand side. 6.1.1 Gauge Symmetry The massless vector ﬁeld Aµ has 4 components, which would naively seem to tell us that the gauge ﬁeld has 4 degrees of freedom. Yet we know that the photon has only two degrees of freedom which we call its polarization states. How are we going to resolve this discrepancy? There are two related comments which will ensure that quantizing the gauge ﬁeld Aµ gives rise to 2 degrees of freedom, rather than 4.\n\n• The ﬁeld A0 has no kinetic term ˙A0 in the Lagrangian: it is not dynamical. This means that if we are given some initial data Ai and ˙Ai at a time t0, then the ﬁeld A0 is fully determined by the equation of motion ∇· ⃗E = 0 which, expanding out, reads\n\n∇2A0 + ∇· ∂⃗A\n\n∂t = 0 (6.9) This has the solution A0(⃗x) = Z d3x′ (∇· ∂⃗A/∂t)(⃗x ′) 4π|⃗x −⃗x ′| (6.10) So A0 is not independent: we don’t get to specify A0 on the initial time slice. It looks like we have only 3 degrees of freedom in Aµ rather than 4. But this is still one too many.\n\n• The Lagrangian (6.3) has a very large symmetry group, acting on the vector potential as Aµ(x) →Aµ(x) + ∂µλ(x) (6.11) for any function λ(x). We’ll ask only that λ(x) dies oﬀsuitably quickly at spatial ⃗x →∞. We call this a gauge symmetry. The ﬁeld strength is invariant under the gauge symmetry: Fµν →∂µ(Aν + ∂νλ) −∂ν(Aµ + ∂µλ) = Fµν (6.12)\n\n– 125 – So what are we to make of this? We have a theory with an inﬁnite number of symmetries, one for each function λ(x). Previously we only encountered symmetries which act the same at all points in spacetime, for example ψ →eiαψ for a complex scalar ﬁeld. Noether’s theorem told us that these symmetries give rise to conservation laws. Do we now have an inﬁnite number of conservation laws?\n\nThe answer is no! Gauge symmetries have a very diﬀerent interpretation than the global symmetries that we make use of in Noether’s theorem. While the latter take a physical state to another physical state with the same properties, the gauge symmetry is to be viewed as a redundancy in our description. That is, two states related by a gauge symmetry are to be identiﬁed: they are the same physical state. (There is a small caveat to this statement which is explained in Section 6.3.1). One way to see that this interpretation is necessary is to notice that Maxwell’s equations are not suﬃcient to specify the evolution of Aµ. The equations read, [ηµν(∂ρ∂ρ) −∂µ∂ν] Aν = 0 (6.13) But the operator [ηµν(∂ρ∂ρ)−∂µ∂ν] is not invertible: it annihilates any function of the form ∂µλ. This means that given any initial data, we have no way to uniquely determine Aµ at a later time since we can’t distinguish between Aµ and Aµ +∂µλ. This would be problematic if we thought that Aµ is a physical object. However, if we’re happy to identify Aµ and Aµ +∂µλ as corresponding to the same physical state, then our problems disappear. Since gauge invariance is a redundancy of the system, Gauge Orbits Gauge Fixing we might try to formulate the theory purely in terms of the local, physical, gauge invariant objects ⃗E and ⃗B. This is ﬁne for the free classical theory: Maxwell’s equations were, after all, ﬁrst written in terms of ⃗E and ⃗B. But it is not possible to describe certain quantum phenomena, such as the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect, without using the gauge potential Aµ. We will see shortly that we also require the gauge potential to describe classically charged ﬁelds. To describe Nature, it appears that we have to introduce quantities Aµ that we can never measure. Figure 29: The picture that emerges for the theory of electromagnetism is of an enlarged phase space, foliated by gauge orbits as shown in the ﬁgure. All states that lie along a given\n\n– 126 – line can be reached by a gauge transformation and are identiﬁed. To make progress, we pick a representative from each gauge orbit. It doesn’t matter which representative we pick — after all, they’re all physically equivalent. But we should make sure that we pick a “good” gauge, in which we cut the orbits. Diﬀerent representative conﬁgurations of a physical state are called diﬀerent gauges. There are many possibilities, some of which will be more useful in diﬀerent situations. Picking a gauge is rather like picking coordinates that are adapted to a particular problem. Moreover, diﬀerent gauges often reveal slightly diﬀerent aspects of a problem. Here we’ll look at two diﬀerent gauges:\n\n• Lorentz Gauge: ∂µAµ = 0 To see that we can always pick a representative conﬁguration satisfying ∂µAµ = 0, suppose that we’re handed a gauge ﬁeld A′ µ satisfying ∂µ(A′)µ = f(x). Then we choose Aµ = A′ µ + ∂µλ, where\n\n∂µ∂µλ = −f (6.14) This equation always has a solution. In fact this condition doesn’t pick a unique representative from the gauge orbit. We’re always free to make further gauge transformations with ∂µ∂µλ = 0, which also has non-trivial solutions. As the name suggests, the Lorentz gauge3 has the advantage that it is Lorentz invariant.\n\n• Coulomb Gauge: ∇· ⃗A = 0 We can make use of the residual gauge transformations in Lorentz gauge to pick ∇· ⃗A = 0. (The argument is the same as before). Since A0 is ﬁxed by (6.10), we have as a consequence A0 = 0 (6.15) (This equation will no longer hold in Coulomb gauge in the presence of charged matter). Coulomb gauge breaks Lorentz invariance, so may not be ideal for some purposes. However, it is very useful to exhibit the physical degrees of freedom: the 3 components of ⃗A satisfy a single constraint: ∇· ⃗A = 0, leaving behind just 2 degrees of freedom. These will be identiﬁed with the two polarization states of the photon. Coulomb gauge is sometimes called radiation gauge. 3Named after Lorenz who had the misfortune to be one letter away from greatness.\n\n– 127 – 6.2 The Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field In the following we shall quantize free Maxwell theory twice: once in Coulomb gauge, and again in Lorentz gauge. We’ll ultimately get the same answers and, along the way, see that each method comes with its own subtleties. The ﬁrst of these subtleties is common to both methods and comes when computing the momentum πµ conjugate to Aµ,\n\nπ0 = ∂L\n\n∂˙A0 = 0\n\nπi = ∂L\n\n∂˙Ai = −F 0i ≡Ei (6.16) so the momentum π0 conjugate to A0 vanishes. This is the mathematical consequence of the statement we made above: A0 is not a dynamical ﬁeld. Meanwhile, the momentum conjugate to Ai is our old friend, the electric ﬁeld. We can compute the Hamiltonian, H = Z d3x πi ˙Ai −L\n\n= Z d3x 1 2 ⃗E · ⃗E + 1 2 ⃗B · ⃗B −A0(∇· ⃗E) (6.17) So A0 acts as a Lagrange multiplier which imposes Gauss’ law\n\n∇· ⃗E = 0 (6.18) which is now a constraint on the system in which ⃗A are the physical degrees of freedom. Let’s now see how to treat this system using diﬀerent gauge ﬁxing conditions. 6.2.1 Coulomb Gauge In Coulomb gauge, the equation of motion for ⃗A is\n\n∂µ∂µ ⃗A = 0 (6.19) which we can solve in the usual way,\n\n⃗A = Z d3p (2π)3 ⃗ξ(⃗p) eip·x (6.20) with p2 0 = |⃗p|2. The constraint ∇· ⃗A = 0 tells us that ⃗ξ must satisfy\n\n⃗ξ · ⃗p = 0 (6.21)\n\n– 128 – which means that ⃗ξ is perpendicular to the direction of motion ⃗p. We can pick ⃗ξ(⃗p) to be a linear combination of two orthonormal vectors ⃗ϵr, r = 1, 2, each of which satisﬁes ⃗ϵr(⃗p) · ⃗p = 0 and\n\n⃗ϵr(⃗p) · ⃗ϵs(⃗p) = δrs r, s = 1, 2 (6.22) These two vectors correspond to the two polarization states of the photon. It’s worth pointing out that you can’t consistently pick a continuous basis of polarization vectors for every value of ⃗p because you can’t comb the hair on a sphere. But this topological fact doesn’t cause any complications in computing QED scattering processes. To quantize we turn the Poisson brackets into commutators. Naively we would write [Ai(⃗x), Aj(⃗y)] = [Ei(⃗x), Ej(⃗y)] = 0 [Ai(⃗x), Ej(⃗y)] = iδj i δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (6.23) But this can’t quite be right, because it’s not consistent with the constraints. We still want to have ∇· ⃗A = ∇· ⃗E = 0, now imposed on the operators. But from the commutator relations above, we see [∇· ⃗A(⃗x), ∇· ⃗E(⃗y)] = i∇2 δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) ̸= 0 (6.24) What’s going on? In imposing the commutator relations (6.23) we haven’t correctly taken into account the constraints. In fact, this is a problem already in the classical theory, where the Poisson bracket structure is already altered4. The correct Poisson bracket structure leads to an alteration of the last commutation relation,\n\n\u0013 δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (6.25) [Ai(⃗x), Ej(⃗y)] = i \u0012 δij −∂i∂j\n\n∇2 To see that this is now consistent with the constraints, we can rewrite the right-hand side of the commutator in momentum space, [Ai(⃗x), Ej(⃗y)] = i Z d3p (2π)3\n\n\u0012 δij −pipj\n\n\u0013 ei⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y) (6.26)\n\n|⃗p| 2 which is now consistent with the constraints, for example [∂iAi(⃗x), Ej(⃗y)] = i Z d3p (2π)3\n\n\u0012 δij −pipj\n\n\u0013 ipi ei⃗p·(⃗x−⃗y) = 0 (6.27)\n\n|⃗p| 2 4For a nice discussion of the classical and quantum dynamics of constrained systems, see the small book by Paul Dirac, “Lectures on Quantum Mechanics”\n\n– 129 – We now write ⃗A in the usual mode expansion, 2 X\n\n⃗A(⃗x) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p r=1 ⃗ϵr(⃗p) h ar ⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x + ar † ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗xi 2|⃗p| 2 X r\n\n⃗E(⃗x) = Z d3p (2π)3(−i)\n\n|⃗p| r=1 ⃗ϵr(⃗p) h ar ⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x −ar † ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗xi (6.28) 2 where, as before, the polarization vectors satisfy\n\n⃗ϵr(⃗p) · ⃗p = 0 and ⃗ϵr(⃗p) · ⃗ϵs(⃗p) = δrs (6.29) It is not hard to show that the commutation relations (6.25) are equivalent to the usual commutation relations for the creation and annihilation operators, [ar ⃗p, as ⃗q] = [ar † ⃗p , as † ⃗q ] = 0 [ar ⃗p, as † ⃗q ] = (2π)3δrs δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (6.30) where, in deriving this, we need the completeness relation for the polarization vectors, 2 X r=1 ϵi r(⃗p)ϵj r(⃗p) = δij −pipj\n\n|⃗p| 2 (6.31) You can easily check that this equation is true by acting on both sides with a basis of vectors (⃗ϵ1(⃗p),⃗ϵ2(⃗p), ⃗p). We derive the Hamiltonian by substituting (6.28) into (6.17). The last term vanishes in Coulomb gauge. After normal ordering, and playing around with ⃗ϵr polarization vectors, we get the simple expression 2 X H = Z d3p (2π)3 |⃗p| r=1 ar † ⃗p ar ⃗p (6.32) The Coulomb gauge has the advantage that the physical degrees of freedom are manifest. However, we’ve lost all semblance of Lorentz invariance. One place where this manifests itself is in the propagator for the ﬁelds Ai(x) (in the Heisenberg picture). In Coulomb gauge the propagator reads Dtr ij(x −y) ≡⟨0| TAi(x)Aj(y) |0⟩= Z d4p (2π)4 i p2 + iϵ\n\n\u0012 δij −pipj\n\n\u0013 e−ip·(x−y) (6.33)\n\n|⃗p|2 The tr superscript on the propagator refers to the “transverse” part of the photon. When we turn to the interacting theory, we will have to ﬁght to massage this propagator into something a little nicer.\n\n– 130 – 6.2.2 Lorentz Gauge We could try to work in a Lorentz invariant fashion by imposing the Lorentz gauge condition ∂µAµ = 0. The equations of motion that follow from the action are then\n\n∂µ∂µAν = 0 (6.34) Our approach to implementing Lorentz gauge will be a little diﬀerent from the method we used in Coulomb gauge. We choose to change the theory so that (6.34) arises directly through the equations of motion. We can achieve this by taking the Lagrangian L = −1 4FµνF µν −1 2(∂µAµ)2 (6.35) The equations of motion coming from this action are\n\n∂µF µν + ∂ν(∂µAµ) = ∂µ∂µAν = 0 (6.36) (In fact, we could be a little more general than this, and consider the Lagrangian 4FµνF µν −1 2α(∂µAµ)2 (6.37) L = −1 with arbitrary α and reach similar conclusions. The quantization of the theory is independent of α and, rather confusingly, diﬀerent choices of α are sometimes also referred to as diﬀerent “gauges”. We will use α = 1, which is called “Feynman gauge”. The other common choice, α = 0, is called “Landau gauge”.) Our plan will be to quantize the theory (6.36), and only later impose the constraint ∂µAµ = 0 in a suitable manner on the Hilbert space of the theory. As we’ll see, we will also have to deal with the residual gauge symmetry of this theory which will prove a little tricky. At ﬁrst, we can proceed very easily, because both π0 and πi are dynamical:\n\nπ0 = ∂L\n\n∂˙A0 = −∂µAµ\n\nπi = ∂L\n\n∂˙Ai = ∂iA0 −˙Ai (6.38) Turning these classical ﬁelds into operators, we can simply impose the usual commutation relations, [Aµ(⃗x), Aν(⃗y)] = [πµ(⃗x), πν(⃗y)] = 0 [Aµ(⃗x), πν(⃗y)] = iηµν δ(3)(⃗x −⃗y) (6.39)\n\n– 131 – and we can make the usual expansion in terms of creation and annihilation operators and 4 polarization vectors (ϵµ)λ, with λ = 0, 1, 2, 3. 3 X Aµ(⃗x) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p\n\nλ=0 ϵλ µ(⃗p) h aλ ⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x + aλ † ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗xi 2|⃗p| 3 X r\n\nπµ(⃗x) = Z d3p (2π)3\n\n|⃗p|\n\nλ=0 (ϵµ)λ(⃗p) h aλ ⃗p ei⃗p·⃗x −aλ † ⃗p e−i⃗p·⃗xi (6.40) 2 (+i) Note that the momentum πµ comes with a factor of (+i), rather than the familiar (−i) that we’ve seen so far. This can be traced to the fact that the momentum (6.38) for the classical ﬁelds takes the form πµ = −˙Aµ + . . .. In the Heisenberg picture, it becomes clear that this descends to (+i) in the deﬁnition of momentum. There are now four polarization 4-vectors ϵλ(⃗p), instead of the two polarization 3vectors that we met in the Coulomb gauge. Of these four 4-vectors, we pick ϵ0 to be timelike, while ϵ1,2,3 are spacelike. We pick the normalization\n\nϵλ · ϵλ′ = ηλλ′ (6.41) which also means that (ϵµ)λ (ϵν)λ′ ηλλ′ = ηµν (6.42) The polarization vectors depend on the photon 4-momentum p = (|⃗p|, ⃗p). Of the two spacelike polarizations, we will choose ϵ1 and ϵ2 to lie transverse to the momentum:\n\nϵ1 · p = ϵ2 · p = 0 (6.43) The third vector ϵ3 is the longitudinal polarization. For example, if the momentum lies along the x3 direction, so p ∼(1, 0, 0, 1), then 1\n\n!\n\n0\n\n!\n\n0\n\n!\n\n0\n\n!\n\nϵ0 =\n\n, ϵ1 =\n\n, ϵ2 =\n\n, ϵ3 = 0 1 0 0 (6.44) 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 For other 4-momenta, the polarization vectors are the appropriate Lorentz transformations of these vectors, since (6.43) are Lorentz invariant. We do our usual trick, and translate the ﬁeld commutation relations (6.39) into those for creation and annihilation operators. We ﬁnd [aλ ⃗p, aλ′ ⃗q ] = [aλ † ⃗p , aλ′ † ⃗q ] = 0 and [aλ ⃗p, aλ′ † ⃗q ] = −ηλλ′ (2π)3 δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (6.45)\n\n– 132 – The minus signs here are odd to say the least! For spacelike λ = 1, 2, 3, everything looks ﬁne, [aλ ⃗p, aλ′ † ⃗q ] = δλλ′ (2π)3 δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) λ, λ′ = 1, 2, 3 (6.46) But for the timelike annihilation and creation operators, we have [a0 ⃗p, a0 † ⃗q ] = −(2π)3 δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (6.47) This is very odd! To see just how strange this is, we take the Lorentz invariant vacuum |0⟩deﬁned by aλ ⃗p |0⟩= 0 (6.48) Then we can create one-particle states in the usual way,\n\n|⃗p, λ⟩= aλ † ⃗p |0⟩ (6.49) For spacelike polarization states, λ = 1, 2, 3, all seems well. But for the timelike polarization λ = 0, the state |⃗p, 0⟩has negative norm,\n\n⟨⃗p, 0| ⃗q, 0⟩= ⟨0| a0 ⃗p a0 † ⃗q |0⟩= −(2π)3 δ(3)(⃗p −⃗q) (6.50) Wtf? That’s very very strange. A Hilbert space with negative norm means negative probabilities which makes no sense at all. We can trace this negative norm back to the wrong sign of the kinetic term for A0 in our original Lagrangian: L = +1 2 ˙⃗A2−1 2 ˙A2 0+. . .. At this point we should remember our constraint equation, ∂µAµ = 0, which, until now, we’ve not imposed on our theory. This is going to come to our rescue. We will see that it will remove the timelike, negative norm states, and cut the physical polarizations down to two. We work in the Heisenberg picture, so that\n\n∂µAµ = 0 (6.51) makes sense as an operator equation. Then we could try implementing the constraint in the quantum theory in a number of diﬀerent ways. Let’s look at a number of increasingly weak ways to do this\n\n• We could ask that ∂µAµ = 0 is imposed as an equation on operators. But this can’t possibly work because the commutation relations (6.39) won’t be obeyed for π0 = −∂µAµ. We need some weaker condition.\n\n– 133 –\n\n• We could try to impose the condition on the Hilbert space instead of directly on the operators. After all, that’s where the trouble lies! We could imagine that there’s some way to split the Hilbert space up into good states |Ψ⟩and bad states that somehow decouple from the system. With luck, our bad states will include the weird negative norm states that we’re so disgusted by. But how can we deﬁne the good states? One idea is to impose\n\n∂µAµ |Ψ⟩= 0 (6.52) on all good, physical states |Ψ⟩. But this can’t work either! Again, the condition is too strong. For example, suppose we decompose Aµ(x) = A+ µ (x) + A− µ (x) with 3 X A+ µ (x) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p\n\nλ=0 ϵλ µaλ ⃗p e−ip·x 2|⃗p| 3 X A− µ (x) = Z d3p (2π)3 1 p\n\nλ=0 ϵλ µaλ † ⃗p e+ip·x (6.53) 2|⃗p| Then, on the vacuum A+ µ |0⟩= 0 automatically, but ∂µA− µ |0⟩̸= 0. So not even the vacuum is a physical state if we use (6.52) as our constraint\n\n• Our ﬁnal attempt will be the correct one. In order to keep the vacuum as a good physical state, we can ask that physical states |Ψ⟩are deﬁned by\n\n∂µA+ µ |Ψ⟩= 0 (6.54) This ensures that\n\n⟨Ψ′| ∂µAµ |Ψ⟩= 0 (6.55) so that the operator ∂µAµ has vanishing matrix elements between physical states. Equation (6.54) is known as the Gupta-Bleuler condition. The linearity of the constraint means that the physical states |Ψ⟩span a physical Hilbert space Hphys. So what does the physical Hilbert space Hphys look like? And, in particular, have we rid ourselves of those nasty negative norm states so that Hphys has a positive deﬁnite inner product deﬁned on it? The answer is actually no, but almost!\n\nLet’s consider a basis of states for the Fock space. We can decompose any element of this basis as |Ψ⟩= |ψT⟩|φ⟩, where |ψT⟩contains only transverse photons, created by\n\n– 134 – a1,2 † ⃗p , while |φ⟩contains the timelike photons created by a0 † ⃗p and longitudinal photons created by a3 † ⃗p . The Gupta-Bleuler condition (6.54) requires (a3 ⃗p −a0 ⃗p) |φ⟩= 0 (6.56) This means that the physical states must contain combinations of timelike and longitudinal photons. Whenever the state contains a timelike photon of momentum ⃗p, it must also contain a longitudinal photon with the same momentum. In general |φ⟩will be a linear combination of states |φn⟩containing n pairs of timelike and longitudinal photons, which we can write as\n\n∞ X\n\n|φ⟩= n=0 Cn |φn⟩ (6.57) where |φ0⟩= |0⟩is simply the vacuum. It’s not hard to show that although the condition (6.56) does indeed decouple the negative norm states, all the remaining states involving timelike and longitudinal photons have zero norm\n\n⟨φm| φn⟩= δn0δm0 (6.58) This means that the inner product on Hphys is positive semi-deﬁnite. Which is an improvement. But we still need to deal with all these zero norm states. The way we cope with the zero norm states is to treat them as gauge equivalent to the vacuum. Two states that diﬀer only in their timelike and longitudinal photon content, |φn⟩with n ≥1 are said to be physically equivalent. We can think of the gauge symmetry of the classical theory as descending to the Hilbert space of the quantum theory. Of course, we can’t just stipulate that two states are physically identical unless they give the same expectation value for all physical observables. We can check that this is true for the Hamiltonian, which can be easily computed to be 3 X\n\n!\n\nH = Z d3p (2π)3 |⃗p| i=1 ai † ⃗p ai ⃗p −a0 † ⃗p a0 ⃗p (6.59) But the condition (6.56) ensures that ⟨Ψ| a3 † ⃗p a3 ⃗p |Ψ⟩= ⟨Ψ| a0 † ⃗p a0 ⃗p |Ψ⟩so that the contributions from the timelike and longitudinal photons cancel amongst themselves in the Hamiltonian. This also renders the Hamiltonian positive deﬁnite, leaving us just with the contribution from the transverse photons as we would expect. In general, one can show that the expectation values of all gauge invariant operators evaluated on physical states are independent of the coeﬃcients Cn in (6.57).\n\n– 135 – Propagators Finally, it’s a simple matter to compute the propagator in Lorentz gauge. It is given by\n\n⟨0| T Aµ(x)Aν(y) |0⟩= Z d4p (2π)4 −iηµν p2 + iϵ e−ip·(x−y) (6.60) This is a lot nicer than the propagator we found in Coulomb gauge: in particular, it’s Lorentz invariant. We could also return to the Lagrangian (6.37). Had we pushed through the calculation with arbitrary coeﬃcient α, we would ﬁnd the propagator,\n\n⟨0| T Aµ(x)Aν(y) |0⟩= Z d4p (2π)4 −i p2 + iϵ\n\n\u0012 ηµν + (α −1)pµpν\n\n\u0013 e−ip·(x−y) (6.61) p2 6.3 Coupling to Matter Let’s now build an interacting theory of light and matter. We want to write down a Lagrangian which couples Aµ to some matter ﬁelds, either scalars or spinors. For example, we could write something like 4FµνF µν −jµAµ (6.62) L = −1 where jµ is some function of the matter ﬁelds. The equations of motion read\n\n∂µF µν = jν (6.63) so, for consistency, we require\n\n∂µjµ = 0 (6.64) In other words, jµ must be a conserved current. But we’ve got lots of those! Let’s look at how we can couple two of them to electromagnetism. 6.3.1 Coupling to Fermions The Dirac Lagrangian L = ¯ψ(i /∂−m)ψ (6.65) has an internal symmetry ψ →e−iαψ and ¯ψ →e+iα ¯ψ, with α ∈R. This gives rise to the conserved current jµ V = ¯ψγµψ. So we could look at the theory of electromagnetism coupled to fermions, with the Lagrangian, 4FµνF µν + ¯ψ(i /∂−m)ψ −e ¯ψγµAµψ (6.66) L = −1\n\n– 136 – where we’ve introduced a coupling constant e. For the free Maxwell theory, we have seen that the existence of a gauge symmetry was crucial in order to cut down the physical degrees of freedom to the requisite 2. Does our interacting theory above still have a gauge symmetry? The answer is yes. To see this, let’s rewrite the Lagrangian as 4FµνF µν + ¯ψ(i /D −m)ψ (6.67) L = −1 where Dµψ = ∂µψ + ieAµψ is called the covariant derivative. This Lagrangian is invariant under gauge transformations which act as Aµ →Aµ + ∂µλ and ψ →e−ieλψ (6.68) for an arbitrary function λ(x). The tricky term is the derivative acting on ψ, since this will also hit the e−ieλ piece after the transformation. To see that all is well, let’s look at how the covariant derivative transforms. We have Dµψ = ∂µψ + ieAµψ\n\n→∂µ(e−ieλψ) + ie(Aµ + ∂µλ)(e−ieλψ)\n\n= e−ieλDµψ (6.69) so the covariant derivative has the nice property that it merely picks up a phase under the gauge transformation, with the derivative of e−ieλ cancelling the transformation of the gauge ﬁeld. This ensures that the whole Lagrangian is invariant, since ¯ψ → e+ieλ(x) ¯ψ. Electric Charge The coupling e has the interpretation of the electric charge of the ψ particle. This follows from the equations of motion of classical electromagnetism ∂µF µν = jν: we know that the j0 component is the charge density. We therefore have the total charge Q given by Q = e Z d3x ¯ψ(⃗x)γ0ψ(⃗x) (6.70) After treating this as a quantum equation, we have 2 X Q = e Z d3p (2π)3 s=1 (bs † ⃗p bs ⃗p −cs † ⃗p cs ⃗p) (6.71) which is the number of particles, minus the number of antiparticles. Note that the particle and the anti-particle are required by the formalism to have opposite electric\n\n– 137 – charge. For QED, the theory of light interacting with electrons, the electric charge is usually written in terms of the dimensionless ratio α, known as the ﬁne structure constant\n\nα = e2 4πℏc ≈ 1 137 (6.72) Setting ℏ= c = 1, we have e = √ 4πα ≈0.3. There’s a small subtlety here that’s worth elaborating on. I stressed that there’s a radical diﬀerence between the interpretation of a global symmetry and a gauge symmetry. The former takes you from one physical state to another with the same properties and results in a conserved current through Noether’s theorem. The latter is a redundancy in our description of the system. Yet in electromagnetism, the gauge symmetry ψ →e+ieλ(x)ψ seems to lead to a conservation law, namely the conservation of electric charge. This is because among the inﬁnite number of gauge symmetries parameterized by a function λ(x), there is also a single global symmetry: that with λ(x) = constant. This is a true symmetry of the system, meaning that it takes us to another physical state. More generally, the subset of global symmetries from among the gauge symmetries are those for which λ(x) →α = constant as x →∞. These take us from one physical state to another. Finally, let’s check that the 4 × 4 matrix C that we introduced in Section 4.5 really deserves the name “charge conjugation matrix”. If we take the complex conjugation of the Dirac equation, we have (iγµ∂µ −eγµAµ −m)ψ = 0 ⇒ (−i(γµ)⋆∂µ −e(γµ)⋆Aµ −m)ψ⋆= 0 Now using the deﬁning equation C†γµC = −(γµ)⋆, and the deﬁnition ψ(c) = Cψ⋆, we see that the charge conjugate spinor ψ(c) satisﬁes (iγµ∂µ + eγµAµ −m)ψ(c) = 0 (6.73) So we see that the charge conjugate spinor ψ(c) satisﬁes the Dirac equation, but with charge −e instead of +e. 6.3.2 Coupling to Scalars For a real scalar ﬁeld, we have no suitable conserved current. This means that we can’t couple a real scalar ﬁeld to a gauge ﬁeld.\n\n– 138 – Let’s now consider a complex scalar ﬁeld ϕ. (For this section, I’ll depart from our previous notation and call the scalar ﬁeld ϕ to avoid confusing it with the spinor). We have a symmetry ϕ →e−iαϕ. We could try to couple the associated current to the gauge ﬁeld, Lint = −i((∂µϕ⋆)ϕ −ϕ⋆∂µϕ)Aµ (6.74) But this doesn’t work because\n\n• The theory is no longer gauge invariant\n\n• The current jµ that we coupled to Aµ depends on ∂µϕ. This means that if we try to compute the current associated to the symmetry, it will now pick up a contribution from the jµAµ term. So the whole procedure wasn’t consistent. We solve both of these problems simultaneously by remembering the covariant derivative. In this scalar theory, the combination Dµϕ = ∂µϕ + ieAµϕ (6.75) again transforms as Dµϕ →e−ieλDµϕ under a gauge transformation Aµ →Aµ + ∂µλ and ϕ →e−ieλϕ. This means that we can construct a gauge invariant action for a charged scalar ﬁeld coupled to a photon simply by promoting all derivatives to covariant derivatives L = −1 4FµνF µν + Dµϕ⋆Dµϕ −m2|ϕ|2 (6.76) In general, this trick works for any theory. If we have a U(1) symmetry that we wish to couple to a gauge ﬁeld, we may do so by replacing all derivatives by suitable covariant derivatives. This procedure is known as minimal coupling. 6.4 QED Let’s now work out the Feynman rules for the full theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) – the theory of electrons interacting with light. The Lagrangian is L = −1 4FµνF µν + ¯ψ(i /D −m)ψ (6.77) where Dµ = ∂µ + ieAµ. The route we take now depends on the gauge choice. If we worked in Lorentz gauge previously, then we can jump straight to Section 6.5 where the Feynman rules for QED are written down. If, however, we worked in Coulomb gauge, then we still have a bit of work in front of us in order to massage the photon propagator into something Lorentz invariant. We will now do that.\n\n– 139 – In Coulomb gauge ∇· ⃗A = 0, the equation of motion arising from varying A0 is now\n\n−∇2A0 = eψ†ψ ≡ej0 (6.78) which has the solution A0(⃗x, t) = e Z d3x′ j0(⃗x ′, t) 4π|⃗x −⃗x ′| (6.79) In Coulomb gauge we can rewrite the Maxwell part of the Lagrangian as LMaxwell = Z d3x 1 2 ⃗E2 −1 2 ⃗B2\n\n= Z d3x 1 2( ˙⃗A + ∇A0)2 −1 2 ⃗B2\n\n= Z d3x 1 2 ˙⃗A 2 + 1 2(∇A0)2 −1 2 ⃗B2 (6.80) where the cross-term has vanished using ∇· ⃗A = 0. After integrating the second term by parts and inserting the equation for A0, we have Z d3x′ j0(⃗x)j0(⃗x ′) 2 ⃗B 2 + e2\n\n\u0015 (6.81) LMaxwell = Z d3x \u0014 1 2 ˙⃗A 2 −1 4π|⃗x −⃗x ′| 2 We ﬁnd ourselves with a nonlocal term in the action. This is exactly the type of interaction that we boasted in Section 1.1.4 never arises in Nature! It appears here as an artifact of working in Coulomb gauge: it does not mean that the theory of QED is nonlocal. For example, it wouldn’t appear if we worked in Lorentz gauge. We now compute the Hamiltonian. Changing notation slightly from previous chapters, we have the conjugate momenta,\n\n⃗Π = ∂L\n\n∂˙⃗A = ˙⃗A\n\nπψ = ∂L\n\n∂˙ψ = iψ† (6.82) which gives us the Hamiltonian Z d3x′ j0(⃗x)j0(⃗x ′) 2 ⃗B2 + ¯ψ(−iγi∂i + m)ψ −e⃗j · ⃗A + e2 H = Z d3x \u0014\n\n\u0015 1 2 ˙⃗A 2 + 1 4π|⃗x −⃗x ′| 2 where ⃗j = ¯ψ⃗γψ and j0 = ¯ψγ0ψ.\n\n– 140 – 6.4.1 Naive Feynman Rules We want to determine the Feynman rules for this theory. For fermions, the rules are the same as those given in Section 5. The new pieces are:\n\n• We denote the photon by a wavy line. Each end of the line comes with an i, j = 1, 2, 3 index telling us the component of ⃗A. We calculated the transverse photon\n\n\u0012 δij −pipj\n\n\u0013 propagator in (6.33): it is and contributes Dtr ij = i p2 + iϵ\n\n|⃗p|2\n\n• The vertex contributes −ieγi. The index on γi contracts with the index on the photon line. x y\n\n• The non-local interaction which, in position space, is given by contributes a factor of i(eγ0)2δ(x0 −y0) 4π|⃗x −⃗y| These Feynman rules are rather messy. This is the price we’ve paid for working in Coulomb gauge. We’ll now show that we can massage these expressions into something much more simple and Lorentz invariant. Let’s start with the oﬀending instantaneous interaction. Since it comes from the A0 component of the gauge ﬁeld, we could try to redeﬁne the propagator to include a D00 piece which will capture this term. In fact, it ﬁts quite nicely in this form: if we look in momentum space, we have\n\nδ(x0 −y0) 4π|⃗x −⃗y| = Z d4p (2π)4 eip·(x−y)\n\n|⃗p|2 (6.83) so we can combine the non-local interaction with the transverse photon propagator by deﬁning a new photon propagator\n\n+ i\n\n     \n\n|⃗p|2 µ, ν = 0\n\n\u0012 δij −pipj\n\n\u0013 µ = i ̸= 0, ν = j ̸= 0 i p2 + iϵ (6.84) Dµν(p) =\n\n|⃗p|2\n\n     0 otherwise With this propagator, the wavy photon line now carries a µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3 index, with the extra µ = 0 component taking care of the instantaneous interaction. We now need to change our vertex slightly: the −ieγi above gets replaced by −ieγµ which correctly accounts for the (eγ0)2 piece in the instantaneous interaction.\n\n– 141 – The D00 piece of the propagator doesn’t look a whole lot diﬀerent from the transverse photon propagator. But wouldn’t it be nice if they were both part of something more symmetric! In fact, they are. We have the following: Claim: We can replace the propagator Dµν(p) with the simpler, Lorentz invariant propagator Dµν(p) = −iηµν p2 (6.85) Proof: There is a general proof using current conservation. Here we’ll be more pedestrian and show that we can do this for certain Feynman diagrams. In particular, we focus on a particular tree-level diagram that contributes to e−e−→e−e−scattering, p / p\n\n∼e2[¯u(p′)γµu(p)] Dµν(k) [¯u(q′)γνu(q)] (6.86)\n\n/ q q where k = p −p′ = q′ −q. Recall that u(⃗p) satisﬁes the equation ( /p −m)u(⃗p) = 0 (6.87) Let’s deﬁne the spinor contractions αµ = ¯u(⃗p ′)γµu(⃗p) and βν = ¯u(⃗q ′)γνu(⃗q). Then since k = p −p′ = q′ −q, we have kµαµ = ¯u(⃗p ′)( /p −/p ′)u(⃗p) = ¯u(⃗p ′)(m −m)u(⃗p) = 0 (6.88) and, similarly, kνβν = 0. Using this fact, the diagram can be written as\n\n!\n\n⃗α · ⃗β k2 −(⃗α · ⃗k)(⃗β · ⃗k) k2|⃗k|2 + α0β0\n\nαµDµνβν = i\n\n|⃗k|2\n\n⃗α · ⃗β\n\n!\n\nk2 −k2 0α0β0 k2|⃗k|2 + α0β0\n\n= i\n\n|⃗k|2\n\n⃗α · ⃗β\n\n!\n\nk2 − 1 k2|⃗k|2 (k2 0 −k2) α0β0\n\n= i k2α · β = αµ \u0012 −iηµν\n\n\u0013 βν (6.89)\n\n= −i k2\n\n– 142 – which is the claimed result. You can similarly check that the same substitution is legal in the diagram p\n\n/ p\n\n/ ∼e2[¯v(⃗q)γµu(⃗p)]Dµν(k)[¯u(⃗p ′)γνv(⃗q ′)] (6.90) q q In fact, although we won’t show it here, it’s a general fact that in every Feynman diagram we may use the very nice, Lorentz invariant propagator Dµν = −iηµν/p2. □ Note: This is the propagator we found when quantizing in Lorentz gauge (using the Feynman gauge parameter). In general, quantizing the Lagrangian (6.37) in Lorentz gauge, we have the propagator\n\n\u0012 ηµν + (α −1)pµpν\n\n\u0013 (6.91) Dµν = −i p2 p2 Using similar arguments to those given above, you can show that the pµpν/p2 term cancels in all diagrams. For example, in the following diagrams the pµpν piece of the propagator contributes as\n\n∼¯u(p′)γµu(p) kµ = ¯u(p′)( /p −/p ′)u(p) = 0\n\n∼¯v(p)γµu(q) kµ = ¯u(p)( /p + /q ′)u(q) = 0 (6.92) 6.5 Feynman Rules Finally, we have the Feynman rules for QED. For vertices and internal lines, we write\n\n• Vertex: −ieγµ\n\n• Photon Propagator: −iηµν p2 + iϵ\n\n• Fermion Propagator: i( /p + m) p2 −m2 + iϵ For external lines in the diagram, we attach\n\n• Photons: We add a polarization vector ϵµ in/ϵµ out for incoming/outgoing photons. In Coulomb gauge, ϵ0 = 0 and ⃗ϵ · ⃗p = 0.\n\n• Fermions: We add a spinor ur(⃗p)/¯ur(⃗p) for incoming/outgoing fermions. We add a spinor ¯vr(⃗p)/vr(⃗p) for incoming/outgoing anti-fermions.\n\n– 143 – 6.5.1 Charged Scalars “Pauli asked me to calculate the cross section for pair creation of scalar particles by photons. It was only a short time after Bethe and Heitler had solved the same problem for electrons and positrons. I met Bethe in Copenhagen at a conference and asked him to tell me how he did the calculations. I also inquired how long it would take to perform this task; he answered, “It would take me three days, but you will need about three weeks.” He was right, as usual; furthermore, the published cross sections were wrong by a factor of four.” Viki Weisskopf The interaction terms in the Lagrangian for charged scalars come from the covariant derivative terms, L = Dµψ† Dµψ = ∂µψ†∂µψ −ieAµ(ψ†∂µψ −ψ∂µψ†) + e2AµAµψ†ψ (6.93) This gives rise to two interaction vertices. But the cubic vertex is something we haven’t seen before: it contains kinetic terms. How do these appear in the Feynman rules? After a Fourier transform, the derivative term means that the interaction is stronger for fermions with higher momentum, so we include a momentum factor in the Feynman rule. There is also a second, “seagull” graph. The two Feynman rules are p q −ie(p + q)µ and + 2ie2ηµν The factor of two in the seagull diagram arises because of the two identical particles appearing in the vertex. (It’s the same reason that the 1/4! didn’t appear in the Feynman rules for φ4 theory). 6.6 Scattering in QED Let’s now calculate some amplitudes for various processes in quantum electrodynamics, with a photon coupled to a single fermion. We will consider the analogous set of processes that we saw in Section 3 and Section 5. We have\n\n– 144 – Electron Scattering Electron scattering e−e−→e−e−is described by the two leading order Feynman diagrams, given by p,s p,s / p,s\n\n/ /q,r\n\n/\n\n= −i(−ie)2 \u0012[¯us′(⃗p ′)γµus(⃗p)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′)γµur(⃗q)]\n\n+ (p′ −p)2\n\n/ / q,r\n\n−[¯us′(⃗p ′)γµur(⃗q)] [¯ur′(⃗q ′)γµus(⃗p)]\n\n\u0013 p,s / / q,r q,r (p −q′)2 The overall −i comes from the −iηµν in the propagator, which contract the indices on the γ-matrices (remember that it’s really positive for µ, ν = 1, 2, 3). Electron Positron Annihilation Let’s now look at e−e+ →2γ, two gamma rays. The two lowest order Feynman diagrams are,\n\nν 1\n\nε p,s p,s\n\nε1 ν p /\n\n= i(−ie)2 ¯vr(⃗q) \u0012γµ( /p −/p ′ + m)γν p / (p −p′)2 −m2\n\n+\n\n/q\n\n+ γν( /p −/q ′ + m)γµ\n\n/q\n\n\u0013 us(⃗p)ϵν 1(⃗p ′)ϵµ 2(⃗q ′)\n\nεµ 2 q,r q,r (p −q′)2 −m2\n\nεµ 2 Electron Positron Scattering For e−e+ →e−e+ scattering (sometimes known as Bhabha scattering) the two lowest order Feynman diagrams are p,s p,s p,s / p,s / /\n\n= −i(−ie)2 \u0012 −[¯us′(⃗p ′)γµus(⃗p)] [¯vr(⃗q)γµvr′(⃗q ′)]\n\n/\n\n+ (p −p′)2\n\n/ /q,r\n\n+ [¯vr(⃗q)γµus(⃗p)] [¯us′(⃗p ′)γµvr′(⃗q ′)]\n\n\u0013\n\n/ / q,r q,r q,r (p + q)2 Compton Scattering The scattering of photons (in particular x-rays) oﬀelectrons e−γ →e−γ is known as Compton scattering. Historically, the change in wavelength of the photon in the\n\n– 145 – scattering process was one of the conclusive pieces of evidence that light could behave as a particle. The amplitude is given by,\n\nεin q) ( out ε /q( ) out ε /q εin q ( ) ( )\n\n+ u(p) u(p)/ − u(p) u(p)/ − (p + q)2 −m2 + γν( /p −/q ′ + m)γµ\n\n= i(−ie)2¯ur′(⃗p ′) \u0012γµ( /p + /q + m)γν\n\n\u0013 us(⃗p) ϵν in ϵµ out (p −q′)2 −m2 This amplitude vanishes for longitudinal photons. For example, suppose ϵin ∼q. Then, using momentum conservation p + q = p′ + q′, we may write the amplitude as (p + q)2 −m2 + /q( /p ′ −/q + m) /ϵout (p′ −q)2 −m2\n\n!\n\n/ϵout( /p + /q + m) /q iA = i(−ie)2¯ur′(⃗p ′) us(⃗p)\n\n= i(−ie)2¯ur′(⃗p ′) /ϵoutus(⃗p) \u0012 2p · q (p + q)2 −m2 + 2p′ · q (p′ −q)2 −m2\n\n\u0013 (6.94) where, in going to the second line, we’ve performed some γ-matrix manipulations, and invoked the fact that q is null, so /q /q = 0, together with the spinor equations ( /p−m)u(⃗p) and ¯u(⃗p ′)( /p ′ −m) = 0. We now recall the fact that q is a null vector, while p2 = (p′)2 = m2 since the external legs are on mass-shell. This means that the two denominators in the amplitude read (p+q)2−m2 = 2p·q and (p′−q)−m2 = −2p′·q. This ensures that the combined amplitude vanishes for longitudinal photons as promised. A similar result holds when /ϵout ∼q′. Photon Scattering In QED, photons no longer pass through each other unimpeded. At one-loop, there is a diagram which leads to photon scattering. Although naively logarithmically divergent, the diagram is actually rendered ﬁnite by gauge invariance. Figure 30: Adding Muons Adding a second fermion into the mix, which we could identify as a muon, new processes become possible. For example, we can now have processes such as e−µ−→e−µ−scattering, and e+e−annihilation into a muon anti-muon pair. Using our standard notation of p and q for incoming momenta, and p′ and q′ for outgoing\n\n– 146 – momenta, we have the amplitudes given by e− e−\n\n−\n\nµ e\n\n−\n\n∼ 1 (p −p′)2 and\n\n∼ 1 (p + q)2 (6.95)\n\n+ + e\n\nµ\n\nµ− µ− 6.6.1 The Coulomb Potential We’ve come a long way. We’ve understood how to compute quantum amplitudes in a large array of ﬁeld theories. To end this course, we use our newfound knowledge to rederive a result you learnt in kindergarten: Coulomb’s law. To do this, we repeat our calculation that led us to the Yukawa force in Sections 3.5.2 and 5.7.2. We start by looking at e−e−→e−e−scattering. We have p,s p,s /\n\n/\n\n= −i(−ie)2 [¯u(⃗p ′)γµu(⃗p)] [¯u(⃗q ′)γµu(⃗q)] (p′ −p)2 (6.96)\n\n/ / q,r q,r\n\nξ\n\n!\n\nFollowing (5.49), the non-relativistic limit of the spinor is u(p) →√m\n\n. This\n\nξ means that the γ0 piece of the interaction gives a term ¯us(⃗p)γ0ur(⃗q) →2mδrs, while the spatial γi, i = 1, 2, 3 pieces vanish in the non-relativistic limit: ¯us(⃗p)γiur(⃗q) →0. Comparing the scattering amplitude in this limit to that of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we have the eﬀective potential between two electrons given by, U(⃗r) = +e2 Z d3p (2π)3 ei⃗p·⃗r\n\n|⃗p|2 = + e2 4πr (6.97) We ﬁnd the familiar repulsive Coulomb potential. We can trace the minus sign that gives a repulsive potential to the fact that only the A0 component of the intermediate propagator ∼−iηµν contributes in the non-relativistic limit. For e−e+ →e−e+ scattering, the amplitude is p,s p,s /\n\n/\n\n= +i(−ie)2 [¯u(⃗p ′)γµu(⃗p)] [¯v(⃗q)γµv(⃗q ′)] (p′ −p)2 (6.98)\n\n/ / q,r q,r\n\n– 147 – The overall + sign comes from treating the fermions correctly: we saw the same minus sign when studying scattering in Yukawa theory. The diﬀerence now comes from looking at the non-relativistic limit. We have ¯vγ0v →2m, giving us the potential between opposite charges, U(⃗r) = −e2 Z d3p (2π)3 ei⃗p·⃗r\n\n|⃗p|2 = −e2 4πr (6.99) Reassuringly, we ﬁnd an attractive force between an electron and positron. The diﬀerence from the calculation of the Yukawa force comes again from the zeroth component of the gauge ﬁeld, this time in the guise of the γ0 sandwiched between ¯vγ0v →2m, rather than the ¯vv →−2m that we saw in the Yukawa case. The Coulomb Potential for Scalars There are many minus signs in the above calculation which somewhat obscure the crucial one which gives rise to the repulsive force. A careful study reveals the oﬀending sign to be that which sits in front of the A0 piece of the photon propagator −iηµν/p2. Note that with our signature (+−−−), the propagating Ai have the correct sign, while A0 comes with the wrong sign. This is simpler to see in the case of scalar QED, where we don’t have to worry about the gamma matrices. From the Feynman rules of Section 6.5.1, we have the non-relativistic limit of scalar e−e−scattering, p,s p,s /\n\n/\n\n= −iηµν(−ie)2 (p + p′)µ(q + q′)ν (p′ −p)2 →−i(−ie)2 (2m)2\n\n−(⃗p −⃗p ′)2\n\n/ / q,r q,r where the non-relativistic limit in the numerator involves (p+p′)·(q+q′) ≈(p+p′)0(q+ q′)0 ≈(2m)2 and is responsible for selecting the A0 part of the photon propagator rather than the Ai piece. This shows that the Coulomb potential for spin 0 particles of the same charge is again repulsive, just as it is for fermions. For e−e+ scattering, the amplitude picks up an extra minus sign because the arrows on the legs of the Feynman rules in Section 6.5.1 are correlated with the momentum arrows. Flipping the arrows on one pair of legs in the amplitude introduces the relevant minus sign to ensure that the non-relativistic potential between e−e+ is attractive as expected.\n\n– 148 – 6.7 Afterword In this course, we have laid the foundational framework for quantum ﬁeld theory. Most of the developments that we’ve seen were already in place by the middle of the 1930s, pioneered by people such as Jordan, Dirac, Heisenberg, Pauli and Weisskopf 5. Yet by the end of the 1930s, physicists were ready to give up on quantum ﬁeld theory. The diﬃculty lies in the next terms in perturbation theory. These are the terms that correspond to Feynamn diagrams with loops in them, which we have scrupulously avoided computing in this course. The reason we’ve avoided them is because they typically give inﬁnity! And, after ten years of trying, and failing, to make sense of this, the general feeling was that one should do something else. This from Dirac in 1937, Because of its extreme complexity, most physicists will be glad to see the end of QED But the leading ﬁgures of the day gave up too soon. It took a new generation of postwar physicists — people like Schwinger, Feynman, Tomonaga and Dyson — to return to quantum ﬁeld theory and tame the inﬁnities. The story of how they did that will be told in next term’s course. 5For more details on the history of quantum ﬁeld theory, see the excellent book “QED and the Men who Made it” by Sam Schweber.\n\n– 149 –"}

Introduction 简介 1.1 What we Cannot Derive 我们所不知的事情 在讨论对称性能告诉我们什么之前，我们得先说说需要人为 的在理论中添加些什么。首先，目前没有任何理论可以给出自然 界的常数。这些常数需要实验测定，比如各种相互作用的耦合常 数啊，基本粒子的质量啊这种的。这就是需要人为加入的参数。\n\n除此之外，我们还有很多解释不了的：数字3。这不是术数的 那种神秘主义的东西，而是我们不能解释所有的直接与数字3 相 联系的限制。比如： 1 如果你不理解这个简介中的某 些名词，比如规范理论或者双覆 盖，不需要太过担心。本书将会 详尽的解释，在这里提到只是为 了完整。\n\n• 对应三种标准模型描述的基本作用力有三种规范理论1。这 些力是由分别对应于对称群U(1), SU(2) 和SU(3) 的规范理 论描述的。为什么没有对应SU(4) 带来的基本作用力？没人 知道！\n\n• 轻子有三代，夸克也有三代。为什么没有第四代？我们只能 2 比如，现在宇宙中元素的丰度 是依赖于代的数量的。更进一步， 对撞机实验中有对此的很强的证 据。（见Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 241802） 从实验2中知道没有第四代。 • 我们只在拉格朗日量里面包含Φ 的最低三阶(Φ0, Φ1, Φ2)， 其中Φ 指代一些描述我们的物理系统的东西，是个通称，而 我们用拉格朗日量描述自由（即无相互作用）的场/粒子。\n\n• Poincaré 群双覆盖的基本表示中我们只用到三个，分别对应 自旋0, 1 2 和1。没有基本粒子的自旋是3 2。\n\n这是目前理论中必须人为引入的假设。我们从实验上知道这 些假设是正确的，但是目前为止没有更深刻的原理告诉我们为什 么一到3 就得停。\n\n除此之外，还有两件事情没法从对称性中得到，但却是一个严 4 Chapter 1. 简介 谨的理论所必须考虑的：\n\n• 我们只允许在拉格朗日量中引入尽可能低阶的非平庸微分算 符∂µ。一些理论使用一阶的微分算符∂µ，而另一些理论中， Lorentz 不变性禁止了一阶导数，从而二阶导数∂µ∂µ 是最 低阶的可能的非平庸项。除此之外我们就再也得不到一个合 理的理论了。存在高阶导数项的理论，能量没有下界，这导 致它可以是一个任意大小的负值；因此，这些理论中的态总 可以跃迁到能量更低的态，从而永远不会稳定。\n\n• 类似的，如果半整数自旋的粒子和整数自旋的粒子拥有完全 一样的行为的话，宇宙中就不会有稳定的物质。因此，这两者 必然有某些东西不一样，而我们没得选，只有一种可能而且 合理的选择3是正确的。这引出了半整数自旋粒子的Fermi3 量子场论里一开始使用反对易 子而不是对易子，从而防止理论 没有下界。\n\nDirac 统计的概念和整数自旋粒子的Bose-Einstein 统计的 概念。半整数自旋的粒子从而通常被称为Fermion1，它们中 永远不存在两个粒子处在完全一样的态上。相反，这种情况 对整数自旋的粒子——通常被称为Boson2——是可能的。 最后呢，本书不能导出引力理论。大名鼎鼎的广义相对论就是 优美而准确的描述引力的理论；然而这个理论与其他理论完全不 一样，而导出它的框架则超出了本书的研究范围。尝试将引力问 题划入相同框架下的量子引力理论仍待完善，目前没有人能够成 功得出一个完整的形式。但最后一章我们会对引力做一些评述。\n\n1.2 Book Overview 全书概览

本书从狭义相对论的基本假设出发；一方面，在所有的惯性参 考系——一些相互之间的速度保持恒定的参考系——中，光的速 度不变，为c；而另一方面物理规律在在所有惯性系中相同。\n\n满足这些对称性的所有的变换构成的集合叫做Poincaré 群。 我们接下来介绍一些数学知识从而使得我们能够利用好对称性 和这些对称变换。数学上这一分支叫群论。我们会得到Poincaré 4 严格来说，我们会得到 Poincaré 群的双覆盖而不是 Poincaré 群本身。“双覆盖”这 个词是由于一个群的双覆盖和这 个群的关系是前者的两个元素与 后者的一个元素相对应。这在后 面的节3.3.1中会讲到。\n\n群4的不可约表示——你可以当成是组成其它所有表示的“地基”。 这些表示就是后面用来描述粒子和场的不同自旋的表示。自旋一 方面是对不同种类的粒子和场的标记，而另一方面也可以视为内 禀角动量。\n\n之后介绍力学问题的拉格朗日形式，它使得我们可以方便的 在物理问题里面使用对称性。这里面的核心对象是拉格朗日量，我 们通过考虑对称性来给出不同物理系统的拉格朗日量3。而在此之 上我们就得到了欧拉-拉格朗日方程，从而我们可以得到给定拉格 朗日量下，系统的运动方程。利用Poincaré 群的不可约表示，就 可以导出带有不同自旋的场和粒子的基本运动方程。\n\n这里面的中心思想是在Poincaré 群的作用下，拉格朗日量必 须是不变的。这使得在任意的参考系中得到的运动方程都一样，就 像之前说的那样，“物理规律在在所有惯性系中相同”。 之后我们就会发现对于自旋1 2 场的拉格朗日量的另一个对称 性：在U(1) 变换下的对称性。类似的，对于自旋1 的场的内禀对 称性也可以找到。局域的U(1) 对称性可以使得我们得到自旋1 2 场 和自旋1 场之间的耦合项。带这样的耦合项的拉格朗日量是量子 电动力学的拉格朗日量的正确形式。类似的局域SU(2) 和SU(3) 变换会得到弱和强相互作用的拉格朗日量的正确形式。\n\n作为补充，我们会讨论自发对称破缺和Higgs 机制。这些让 5 在对称性自发破缺前，拉格朗 日量中的描述质量的项会因破坏 对称性而被被禁止 我们能够去描述有质量的粒子5。 之后就可以导出Noether 定理，它给我们展示了对称性和守 恒量之间深刻的联系。在物理量和相应对称性的生成元之间划等 号，就能导出量子力学中最重要的方程4 [ˆxi, ˆpj] = iδij (1.1) 和量子场论中 [ˆΦ(x), ˆπ(y)] = iδ(x −y) (1.2) 接下来可以通过对自旋0 粒子的运动方程，即Klein-Gordon 方程，取非相对论性6极限，来得到了著名的Schrödinger 方程。\n\n6 非相对论性指所有物体相比光 速来说都运动的十分缓慢，从而 狭义相对论的古怪的特性很小不 会被观察到。\n\n3实际上，拉格朗日量是人为写出来的，而不是能够推导出来的。它是我们对 某类体系『唯象』且经验的刻画——译者注 4原书有typo 6 Chapter 1. 简介 而与此同时，我们又认识到了物理量与对称性生成元之间的联系， 这些一起就构成了量子力学的基石。\n\n7Klein-Gordon, Dirac, Proka 和Maxwell 方程 接下来我们从不同的运动方程7的解，和方程(1.2)出发来考察 自由场的量子场论。这之后我们通过仔细审视包含不同自旋场之 间的耦合的拉格朗日量来考虑相互作用。这使得我们可以讨论散 射过程的概率振幅是如何得到的。\n\n我们用Ehrenfest 定理来演示量子和经典力学的联系。更进 一步，我们够得了经典电动力学的基本方程，包括Maxwell 方程 组和Lorentz 力定律。\n\n最后简要的介绍现代引力理论——广义相对论的基本结构，并 点出一些构建引力的量子理论的困难。\n\n这本书的主要精力会花在处理对称性的数学工具，以及导出 被称为标准模型的理论上。标准模型是用量子场论为语言来描述 所有已知的基本粒子的行为的。直到现在，所有标准模型的实验 预言都是正确的。这里引入的其他任何理论都可以看作标准模型 下的特殊情况，比如对于宏观物体：经典力学，或者对于低能的基 本粒子：量子力学。对于现今已知的基本粒子和它们之间相互作 用的情况，我们会在下一小节进行一个快速的概述，以方便那些 不熟悉相关内容的读者。\n\n1.3 Elementary Particles and Fundamental Forces 基本粒子和 基本相互作用力 基本粒子分成两个主要的大类：bosons 和fermions。Pauli 不相容原理说明不能有两个fermions 处在完全相同的态上，而 boson 则可以有任意多个粒子处在同一个态上。这种自然界奇怪 的事实导致了这些粒子截然不同的性质：\n\n• Fermions 构成物质5\n\n• Bosons 构成自然界的力 8 原子有电子，质子和中子组成， 它们都是fermions。然而注意 质子和中子都不是基本的粒子， 它们有夸克组成，而夸克也是 fermions。\n\n这说明，比如，原子是由fermions8组成的，但是电磁相互作用 力是通过被称为光子的bosons 传播的。这带来的一个最令人震惊 的结果是竟然能形成稳定的物质。如果允许有无限多的fermions 处在相同的状态，根本就不可能有稳定的物质存在，我们会在第6章 中讨论。\n\n目前我们知道四种基本作用力\n\n• 电磁相互作用力，通过无质量的光子传播\n\n• 弱相互作用力，通过有质量的W+, W−和Z-bosons 传播。\n\n• 强相互作用力通过无质量的胶子传播。 • 引力，（或许）通过引力子传播。\n\n5这里，『构成』实际上不是很合适的翻译。直译的话应该叫Fermions 对物质 『负责』。不过大体上就是那么个意思吧。—译者注 1.3 基本粒子和基本相互作用力 7 这里面，一些相互作用对应的bosons 是无质量的，而另一些 不是，这揭露了一些自然界的深刻的事情。我们在做好足够的准 备之后会去仔细理解这一点，现在只需要记住每一种相互作用力 都与一个对称性相关。弱相互作用力传递的bosons 是有质量的 说明其对应的对称性被破坏了。这种自发对称破缺是所有基本粒 子质量的起源。我们后面会看到这实际上是通过其与另一种基本 boson，Higgs boson 的耦合来实现的。\n\n9 在第7章中我们会讲，所有的荷 都有着一个相同的美丽起源 基本粒子如果携带某种荷9的时候它可以通过某种力来相互作 用。\n\n• 对于电磁力来说，这种荷就是电荷，而相应的只有带电粒子 能够通过电磁力相互作用。 • 对于弱相互作用力来说，这种荷称为10同位旋。所有已知的 10 通常弱相互作用力的荷会伴 随着“弱”这个前缀，所以也被 称为弱同位旋；而且还存在一种 其它的叫同位旋的概念适用于强 相互作用里面的的复合物。不仅 如此，这不是一个基本的荷，而 本书中会省略“弱”这个前缀。\n\nfermions 都携带同位旋，因此它们之间通过弱作用力来相互 作用。 • 强作用力的荷叫色，因为它与人对色彩的知觉有某种奇妙的 共性。不要被这个名字搞糊涂，这个荷实际上与日常生活中 的色彩没有任何关系。\n\n基本的fermions 被分成两个种类：夸克，组成质子和中子的 基本组成；与轻子，如电子和中微子。其中的区别体现为夸克可以 通过强作用力来相互作用，这就是说他们带色，而轻子则不是这 样。夸克和轻子有三代，每一代有两种粒子： 第一代 第二代 第三代 电荷 同位旋 色 上(u) 粲(c) 顶(t) +2 3e 1 2 ✓ 夸克： 下(d) 奇异(s) 底(b) −1 3e −1 2 ✓ 电子中微子 µ 子中微子 τ 子中微子 0 +1 2 轻子： 电子 µ 子 τ 子 −e −1 2 一般的来说，不同的粒子可以通过标签来识别。除了荷和质量 之外，它们还有很多其他的十分重要的标签，称为自旋，你可以把 它理解为内禀的角动量，我们会在第4.5.4节中得到这一点。Bosons 携带整数自旋，fermions 携带半整数自旋。我们上面列出来的基本 的fermions 都只有1 2 的自旋。基本的bosons 有着1 的自旋。除 此之外，只有一种基本粒子有0 自旋：Higgs boson。\n\n每种粒子都有其反粒子，带着大小完全一样的相反11的标签。\n\n11 除了质量标签。这点目前正 在接受实验的检验，比如瑞士日 内瓦的CERN 进行的ARGIS， ATRAP 和ALPHA 实验。\n\n比如电子的反粒子就是正电子，但是一般的话我们不会人为的说 一个新的名字，只是在原来的粒子前面加上前缀“反”。比如说， 顶夸克的反粒子被称为反顶夸克。有些诸如光子12一类的粒子自己 12 或许还有中微子，这一点目前 正在接受各种关于搜索无中微子 的双光子通道衰变实验研究。\n\n就是自己的反粒子。 上面提到的这些想法之后都会更具体的解释。现在是时候去 尝试推导理解这门能够正确描述粒子大观园中的不同特性是如何 8 Chapter 1. 简介 相互影响在一起的理论了。而第一步，也就是我们下一章的主题， 是Einstein 著名的狭义相对论。\n\n2. Special Relativity 狭义相对论 著名的Michelson-Morley 实验告诉我们，光在任何参考系中 都具有相同的速度1。Albert Einstein 首先意识到这个结果所蕴含 1 日常生活中所观测到的物体的 速度取决于选定的参考系。如果 一个观察者站在火车站上，测得 的火车速度为50km h−1，另一 个观察者以15km h−1 的速度 与火车一同运动，那么测得的 火车速度就应是35km h−1。与 此不同的是，光始终以1.08 × 109km h−1 运动，不论如何相对 于光运动。\n\n的深刻意义，从而在此基础之上建立了狭义相对论。从光速不变原 理出发，Einstein 预言了许多有趣而又悖于常理的现象，最后都被 实验证实是正确的。在这里我们首先阐明狭义相对论的基础，然 后再体会这个原理的强大之处。狭义相对论有两个基本假设：\n\n• 相对性原理：任意惯性系，即任意两个相对速度恒定的参考 系的物理规律相同。 • 光速不变原理：在任意惯性系中的光速均为常数c。\n\n除此之外，我们还假设时空均匀且各向同性。这意味着不论在哪 儿(均匀)，不论朝着什么方向(各向同性) 做实验，物理规律都是 一样的。例如两个物理学家，一个在纽约，一个在东京，他们做完 2 这当然要排除某些参数的影响， 例如重力加速度。\n\n全一样的两个实验，会得到相同2 的物理规律，就算是在火星也 一样。\n\n正确的物理定律不应该随看实验的角度或是进行实验的时间 点而变。1此外，狭义相对论的第一条假设告诉我们，不管是在匀 速运动的马车上，还是是在静止的实验室中，做同一物理实验都 会得到相同的结果。以上论述均与与我们的生活经验相符。举个 例子，如果你闭着眼睛坐在匀速运动的汽车上，你是没有办法分 辨出你是真的在运动还是静止的。\n\n如果没有了各向同性和均匀性，物理学就会遇到很大的麻烦： 1原文为：The laws of physics, formulated correctly, shouldn’t change if you look at the experiment from a different perspective or repeat it tomorrow. 10 Chapter 2. 狭义相对论 从实验中得到的物理定律如果仅仅在空间中的某一点对于确定的 某一方向成立，显然是毫无用处的。 唯一有些不直观的就是狭义相对论的第二条假设，毕竟它违 背了我们所有的日常经验。虽然如此，至今为此所有的实验都表 明这个假设是正确的。\n\n2.1 The Invariant of Special Relativity 狭义相对论的中的不 变量 在接下来的几节中，我们将使用狭义相对论的两个基本假设 推导出Minkowski 度规，有了它，我们就能计算两个物理事件的 “距离”。物理事件在这里指在Minkowski 时空中的点，而整个狭 义相对论都建立在Minkowski 时空之上。我们从而得知任意两个 不同惯性参考系之间的变换必须保证Minkowski 度规不变，通过 这一条件我们能够找到连接两个允许存在的惯性系（也就是光速 为常数的参考系）之间所有的变换2。在本书其余的部分我们将会 用到这些关于变换的知识，来寻找在这些变换下不变的方程。让 我们从一个能导出一条狭义相对论假设的最重要的推论之一的思 想实验开始。设想坐标系中一观察者，在原点处向上发出一个光 脉冲，经过一段时间后被垂直镜面反射回原点。如图2.1所示 有3 个重要的事件： • A: 光从原点发出 • B: 光在镜面上反射\n\n• C: 光回到原点 事件AC 之间的时间间隔为3 图2.1: 思想实验图示\n\n∆t = tC −tA = 2L c (2.1) 3 对于恒定速度v 而言，有v = ∆s ∆t ,∆s 表示经过的距离，∆t 代 表所需时间，因此∆t = ∆s 式中L 表示原点与反射点之间的距离。\n\nv 接下来考虑第二位观察者，在tA 时刻处于他所在的坐标系的 原点，并以恒定速度u 相对于第一个观察者4向左运动。为简便起 见，我们假设第二个参考系的原点在tA 时刻与第一位观察者的坐 标系原点重合。第二位观察者所见到的现象就与第一位不一样了。 在他的参考系中，光脉冲的起点和终点并不在同一位置(见图2.2)。\n\n用数学语言表示： x′ A = 0 ̸= x′ C = u∆t′ → ∆x′ = u∆t′ (2.2) 图2.2: 思想实验图示。\n\n第二位移动观察者向左 移动, 因此第一位观察 带撇物理量代表第二位观察者所测量的量。对于第一位静止系的 观察者而言有 者相对他向右移动 4 那些能将两相对速度恒定的惯 性参考系中的物理量相互转化的 变换称为推动(Boost) 变换, 后 面我们会对此进行详述。\n\nxA = xC → ∆x = 0 (2.3) 2非常类似我们要找旋转变换对应的各个参数的变换规律，而旋转变换保证了 长度的守恒 2.1 狭义相对论的中的不变量 11 假定了第二位观察者运动沿x 轴，因此 y′ A = y′ C z′ A = z′ C → ∆y′ = 0 ∆z′ = 0 (2.4) 那么同样也有 yA = yC zA = zC → ∆y = 0 ∆z = 0 (2.5) 接下来的问题是：第二位观察者所测得的时间间隔是多少？ 因为已经假定了光速为常数，那么事件AC 对于第二位观察者而 言将具有不同的间隔！时间间隔∆t′ = t′ C −t′ A，等于光在第二位 观察者的参考系中走过的距离l 除以光速c。\n\n∆t′ = l c (2.6) 我们可以利用古老的Pythagoras3定理(见图2.2) 计算光传播的距 离 s\u00121 2u∆t′ \u00132 + L2 (2.7) l = 2 利用式(2.6)可以得到 s\u00121 2u∆t′ \u00132 + L2 (2.8) c∆t′ = 2 再利用式(2.2)中的∆x′ = u∆t′ 可得 s\u00121 2u∆t′ \u00132 + L2 c∆t′ = 2\n\n\u00121 2u∆t′ \u00132 + L2 !\n\n→ \u0000 c∆t′\u00012 = 4 5 注意到我们在此处采用的是得 到这个结果的最简方法，因为我 们假定tA 时刻两坐标的原点是 重合的。尽管如此，就算我们任 意选择两惯性参考系原点的关 系，仍然可以证明这个结论，只 是过程会复杂一些。因为物理 定律在任意惯性系中都是一样 的，这给了我们任意选择便于计 算的参考系的自由。如果第二位 观察者的参考系运动方向是任 意的，那就不再有∆y′ = 0 和 ∆z′ = 0，但虽然如此，我们能 够证明方程仍然是成立的，因为 物理定律在任意惯性系中都是一 样的。4\n\n\u00121 2u∆t′ \u00132 + L2 !\n\n→ \u0000 c∆t′\u00012− \u0000 ∆x′\u00012 = 4\n\n− \u0000 ∆x′\u00012 = 4L2 (2.9) 现在回到式(2.1)，即∆t = 2L c ，那么\n\n\u0000 c∆t′\u00012 − \u0000 ∆x′\u00012 = 4L2 = (c∆t)2 = (c∆t)2 −(∆x)2 | {z } =0由式(2.3)知 (2.10) 终于，我们得到5\n\n\u0000 c∆t′\u00012− \u0000 ∆x′\u00012− \u0000 ∆y′\u00012 | {z } =0\n\n− \u0000 ∆z′\u00012 | {z } =0\n\n= (c∆t)2−(∆x)2 | {z } =0\n\n−(∆y)2 | {z } =0\n\n−(∆z)2 | {z } =0 4 译者注：原文的确把这 句话说了两遍 3通译为毕达哥拉斯。\n\n12 Chapter 2. 狭义相对论 (2.11) 考虑第三个观察者，相对于第一个观察者以不同的速度运动，用 同样的推理可以得到\n\n\u0000 c∆t′′\u00012− \u0000 ∆x′′\u00012− \u0000 ∆y′′\u00012− \u0000 ∆z′′\u00012 = (c∆t)2−(∆x)2−(∆y)2−(∆z)2 (2.12) 因此，我们得到了一些对于所有观察者都相同的量: 即二次型 (∆s)2 ≡(c∆t)2 −(∆x)2 −(∆y)2 −(∆z)2 (2.13) 此外，我们还能看出对于不同观察者，(∆x)2 + (∆y)2 + (∆z)2 或者说(c∆t)2 是不同的。我们将在下一节讨论不变量∆s2 所蕴含 的物理意义。\n\n图2.3: 静止物体的世界 线。物体位置不随时间 2.2 Proper Time 固有时 流逝而变化。\n\n我们在上一节推导出了狭义相对论中的不变量∆s2，其在所 有观察者眼中都相同。接下来我们要讨论这个量的物理意义。为 简便起见，我们将问题限制在一维空间中。对于一个相对于观察 者静止的物体，我们能作出它的时空图(见图2.3)。相应的，一个 匀速运动的物体能作出如图2.4所示的时空图。\n\n我们画来用于确定物体在时空中位置的线称为世界线(world line)。世界线总是依赖于观察者的。两不同观察者对于同一物体 图2.4: 某匀速直线运动 可能会画出完全不同的世界线。若一观察者眼中的物体时空图为 图2.4，那么对于速度与物体相同的观察者，其时空图将为图2.5， 物体的世界线。物体前 后经过某两点记为事件 即对于此观察者物体静止。为了解释两位观察者给出的不同描述， A，B。它们间的空间距 离为∆x，时间间隔为 我们引入x′ 和t′ 表示第二位观察者的参考系中的时间和位置。4 我们可以看到，两个观察者将对事件AB 之间的变化持不同观\n\n∆t 点。对于第一位观察者，∆x ̸= 0，但对于第二位观察者，∆x′ = 0。 两观察者都认为事件A 和B 之间的时间间隔非零：∆t ̸= 0 和\n\n∆t′ ̸= 0，且认为∆s2 也相同(见上节推导的结论，任意观察者都 有相同的∆s2)。这将导出一个令人惊讶的结论：事件A 到B 经 历的时间对于两观察者不同 (∆s)2 = (c∆t)2 −(∆x)2 (2.14) 图2.5: 同一个运动物 (∆s′)2 = (c∆t′)2 −(∆x′)2 | {z } =0\n\n= (c∆t′)2 (2.15) 体的世界线，但观察者 与该物体速度相同。该 观察者观测到的事件 AB 之间的空间距离为 (∆s)2 = (∆s′)2 →(∆t′)2 ̸= (∆t′)2 因为(∆x)2 ̸= 0 (2.16)\n\n∆x′ = 0 4注意：我们这里使用的例子与节2.1不同 2.3 速度上限 13 这是有关狭义相对论最著名的一个效应，通常称为钟慢效应 (time-dilation)。时间间隔依赖于观察者，正如空间距离一样。不 同观察者时间流逝速度不同，因此两事件经历的时间也就自然不 同了。 现在时间将变为一个相对的概念，如果我们能找到一个对于 所有观察者都相同的时间量，这将会非常有用。在上述例子中，第 二位观察者与物体有相同的速度，有 (∆s′)2 = (c∆t′)2 (2.17) 上式意味着狭义相对论中的不变量恰为观察者所观测到的时 间间隔乘上光速c。这让我们有机会能用(∆s)2 定义一个对于所 有观察者相同的时间量。我们定义 (∆s)2 = (c∆τ)2 (2.18)\n\nτ 称为固有时(proper time)。固有时是所有相对于该物体静止 的观察者所测量的时间。\n\n当然，现实生活中的物体绝非只能做匀速运动，但我们可以取 足够短的时间(无穷小)，使得运动近似为匀速运动，这样固有时 的概念就说得通了。因此数学上我们需将概念过渡到无穷小，即 ∆→d： (ds)2 = (cdτ)2 = (cdt)2 −(dx)2 −(dy)2 −(dz)2 (2.19) 因此，就算一个物体到处乱跑，我们也能假设一个与物体一起 运动的自带时钟的观察者，这样他总与该物体相对静止。对于这个 特定的观察者而言，他所测量的时间间隔就是固有时，这一数值对 其余观察者也是相同的，因为(ds)2 = (cdτ)2 对于任意观察者成 立。再次强调，这并不意味着对所有观察者都有同样的时间间隔， 只是这些观察者承认该特殊观察者所测量的时间间隔为一不变量 罢了。\n\n2.3 Upper Speed Limit 速度上限 在上节中我们对狭义相对论这一不变量有了解释，现在可以 更进一步，导出另一个狭义相对论的惊人结论。 由于不变量的定义中带有负号，这意味着对于时空中的两个 事件，(∆s)2 的值可能为0。(∆s)2 的值甚至可能是负的，但这样 我们将得到一个复的固有时6，通常复的固有时没有物理意义。因 此，(∆s)2 = 0 时固有时最小，τ = 0，令 6 按固有时定义，(ds)2 = (cdτ)2， (ds)2 < 0 →dτ 为复数。\n\n∆s2 min = 0 = (c∆t)2 −(∆x)2 −(∆y)2 −(∆z)2\n\n→(c∆t)2 = (∆x)2 + (∆y)2 + (∆z)2 14 Chapter 2. 狭义相对论\n\n→c2 = (∆x)2 + (∆y)2 + (∆z)2 (∆t)2 (2.20) 在上式右侧我们有速度平方v2，也就是距离除上时间，把这个式 子写成极限，则\n\n→c2 = (dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2 (dt)2 (2.21) 函数x(t)，y(t)，z(t) 是描述两事件之间路径的参数方程，这样式 子右侧就是两事件间的运动速率。\n\n因此，当某一观察者测得的固有时为0 时其速度将满足下式\n\n→c2 = v2 (2.22) 这意味着没有物体能以超过光速c 的速度运动！5我们给物理学中 的一切事物找到了一个速度上限。时空中的两事件相互影响的传 播速度不能超光速。\n\n这一点满足物理学上的局域性原理(principle of locality)， 即物理学中的对象只能被它邻近的对象影响。相互作用都是局域 的，不存在超距作用，物理效应的传播需要时间。\n\n2.4 The Minkowski Notation Minkowski 记法 从现在起，孤立的空间和孤立的时间注定要消失成为 影子，只有两者的统一才能保持独立的存在。\n\n7 出自Hermann Minkowski 在 Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians(1908.9.21) 上的演 讲\n\n-Hermann Minkowski7 写出狭义相对论中不变量 ds2 = (cdt)2 −(dx)2

在这里我们用了一些新的约定和记号，这些东西在近代物理中应 用很广泛，所以越早熟悉越好： 2.4 Minkowski 记法 15\n\n• Einstein 求和约定：某指标在同一项内出现两次则代表遍历 该指标并求和。例如：P3 i=1 aibi = aibi = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3， 但P3 i=1 aibj = a1bj + a2bj + a3bj ̸= aibj • 像µ，ν，σ 这样的希腊字母8 作指标时，一般代表从0 到3 求和：xµyµ = P3 µ=0 xµyµ • 我们约定变量x0 ≡ct，x1 ≡x，x2 ≡y，x3 ≡z。这样时间 空间地位等同，也便于我们使用Einstein 求和约定 • 引入Minkowski 度规(η 看作一矩阵，ηij 为其矩阵元)：η00 = 1，η11 = −1，η22 = −1，η33 = −1，当µ ̸= ν 时ηµν = 0 (也可以等价的写为9 ηµν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1)) 9ηµν =\n\n\n\n 另外按常规我们还要引入四维矢量(four-vector)，简称4 矢。\n\n1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1\n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n dx0 dx1 dx2 dx3\n\n  \n\n  

\u0001\n\n= dx2 0 −dx2 1 −dx2 2 −dx2 3 (2.26) 采用这种记法能让我们省不少事。对于ds，我们给出的解释 是时空(Minkowski 时空) 中两事件的“距离”，这个“距离”并 不只是空间距离，它还将时间间隔考虑在内。如果我们考虑3 维 Euclidean 空间10中两点间最短距离的平方11 103 维Euclidean 空间就是经典

(2.31) 上式中，变换的上指标是可以任意选择的，这只是为了避免公式 中总是出现ηµν 的一种方法，正如引入Einstein 求和约定是为了 避免总是出现求和号一样。\n\n2.5 Lorentz Transformations Lorentz 变换 下一步，我们将尝试找出两参考系之间不违背狭义相对论基 本假设的变换方式。由上文可知，从狭义相对论的两个基本假设 可以推出对于所有惯性参考系均有ds2 = ηµνdxµdxν，即 ds′2 = dx′ µdx′ νηµν = ds2 = dxµdxνηµν (2.32) 因此，两参考系间所允许的变换要能保证这个二次式的形式，和 Minkowski 时空中的标量积在变换下不变。设变换为Λ，那么变换 后 dxµ →dx′ µ = Λσ µdxσ (2.33) 由于(ds)2 在变换下不变 (ds)2 =

我们将矢量写为列向量，那么按 矩阵相乘的定义有⃗a ·⃗b = ⃗aT ·⃗b。 有关(Oa)T = aTOT 这一点详 见附录C.1，式C.3。\n\n⃗a ·⃗b != ⃗a′ · ⃗b′ = |{z} 注意(Oa)T=aTOT ⃗aTOTO⃗b (2.36) 18 这一条件一般称为正交性 (orthogonality) 条件，因此用 字母O 表示。满足OTO = 1 的矩阵称为正交矩阵，因为它列 与列之间是正交的。换句话说， 矩阵的每一列都可以看做一个矢 量，正交性条件就是说这些矢量 相互正交。\n\n因此18 OT1O != 1，恰巧Euclidean 空间的度规就是单位矩阵1，其 地位正如Minkowski 度规在式(2.35) 中一样。这个性质是旋转的 定义中的一部分，旋转不能改变矢量的长度，即在数学上保证标 量积不变19,6此外我们还注意到旋转不改变坐标系的手向20，这表 明det(O) != 1，因为保证标量积不变的变换除了旋转变换还有空 间反演21。\n\n19 矢量的长度即是矢量与自身 的标量积的平方根。\n\n我们定义保Minkowski 时空中标量积不变的变换为Lorentz 变换(Lorentz transformations) ，这也是为保证狭义相对论的 20 详见附录A.5。\n\n21 空间反演可简单地理解为 映射⃗x →−⃗x。这种变换满足 det(O) != 及OTO = 1。因此， 如果我们要将变换限制为旋转变 换，就需要加上条件det(O) != 1。此外，空间反演变换又称宇称 变换。\n\n假设所必需的。相应的，每当我们需要得到在Lorentz 变换下不变 的项时，都必须结合上下指标：xµyµ = xµyνηµν。在学会一些非常 优雅的技术来处理这样的情况之后，我们会在下一章构建这些转 换具体的矩阵形式。\n\n2.6 Invariance, Symmetry and Covariance 不变性，对称性，协 变性 在继续之前，我们有一些重要的概念要事先声明。首先，一个 量能被称为不变量(invariant)，这个量必须在变换下不变。比如 说，我们考虑一个依赖于不同参数A, B, C, . . . 的任意函数F，F = F(A, B, C, . . . )，如果我们将A, B, C, . . . 变换为A′, B′, C′, . . . ，有 F(A′, B′, C′, . . . ) = F(A, B, C, . . . ) (2.37) 那么F 称为变换下的一个不变量。我们可以用对称性来描述。对 称性(symmetry) 是指在某一变换下或者某一系列变换下保持不 2[(⃗a +⃗b)2 −⃗a2 −⃗b2]，若保证模长不变，标量积也不变。\n\n6译者注：⃗a ·⃗b = 1 18 Chapter 2. 狭义相对论 变的性质。举个例子，如果说一个物理系统在任意的旋转变换下 不变，那么该系统具有旋转对称性。再比如说，一间室温为常温的 房间，房间内各点的温度与位置无关，换言之，如果把所有的点朝 着某特定方向平移一段距离，室温不变。因此我们说室温具有平 移对称性。\n\n协变性与不变性有共通之处而又不同。如果一个方程在变换 下形式不变，那么称这个方程具有协变性。例如下面这个式子 E1 = aA2 + bBA′ + cC4 在变换之后这个方程写为 E′ 1 = aA′2 + bB′A′ + cC′4 那么这个方程具有协变性，因其在变换下形式不变。另一方程 E2 = x2 + 4axy + z 若在变换之后写为 E′ 2 = y′3 + 4az′y′ + y′2 + 8z′x′ 那么它就不是协变的，因为其形式已经变化。\n\n所有的物理规律都应具有Lorentz 协变性7，因为只有这样的 物理规律才能在任意参考系下成立。非协变的物理规律只能在某 一特定参考系下成立，这会导致在东京和纽约具有不同的物理规 律。显然这个主意糟透了，因为不应该存在一个特殊的参考系，我 们得让物理规律在任意参考系中成立。后面我们将讲述如何用协 22Edwin

Lie 代数ˆ= su(2) ⊕su(2)\n\n——SU(2)1有关。之后我们研究Lie 代数，使用相对简单的Lie 代数就能深入研究复杂的Lie 群。不同的群可以有相同的Lie 代 数，但只有其中的一部分是基本的。从上述基础出发就能准确揭\n\n? 双覆盖表示 示自然的基本对称性群——Poincaré 群的双覆盖。我们将利用已 知的变换操作导出Lie 代数，并利用Lie 代数得出对称变换的不 Lorentz 变换+ 平移 同表示。这样就能看出开始时使用的表示其实只是一种特殊情况。\n\n? Poincaré 群 于是又能研究Poincaré 群的重要部分——Lorentz 群，我们会看 到Lorentz 群双覆盖的Lie 代数由两份su(2) Lie 代数所组成，因 此可以直接利用我们熟悉的SU(2) 群的结论。最后将平移变换考 虑进来，就得到了Poincaré 群，Poincaré 群就是Lorentz 群加上 1S 表示特殊(special)，它的含 义为det(M) = 1。U 表示幺正: M†M = 1，数字2 表示这个群 起初是用2 × 2 矩阵定义的。\n\n平移。完成上述所有之后我们终于可以将Poincaré 群双覆盖的基 1指模长为1 的复数。\n\n22 Chapter 3. Lie 群 本表示进行分类，这些在后面的章节中会大用特用，我们将从中 导出物理学的基本定律。\n\n3.1 Groups 群 我们需要合适的数学工具描述对称性。描述对称的数学分支 称为群论，而其中物理中经常遇到的连续对称性则需要群论的一 个分支Lie 理论来进行描述。\n\n我们把对称性定义为变换下的不变性，而描述对称的群就定 义为某些变换的集合。让我们从两个简单例子开始体会群到底该 怎么定义： 1. 正方形在数学上是一些点的集合(例如四个顶点是该集合的 一部分)，正方形的对称性是指在某些变换下(变换: 将一个 点映射到另一个点) 保持不变（点集自身被映射回自身）的 性质。2 符合条件的变换有绕中心旋转90◦, 180◦, 270◦, 0◦等等。这些 旋转操作将正方形映射到它自身。这意味着把集合里的每个 点都映射回了集合里。我们称这个集合(正方形点集) 在这 样的变换下具有不变性。 注意不是所有旋转变换对于正方形都是对称的。如果我们关 注顶点的变化就容易看出来，比如绕中心顺时针旋转5◦，这 个变换将顶点映射到原来正方形点集之外，顶点A 映射到 了原来正方形集合之外的点A′。因此这个旋转变换对正方形 不具有对称性。当然，变换后的点集仍然是个正方形，但却 是另一个正方形(即不同点的集合)。而绕中心转90◦是对称 的，如图3.3，顶点A 变换到点B 等等，原来的正方形点集 变换到相同的集合。\n\n图3.1: 正方形 图3.3: 正方形绕中心旋转90◦ 2译者注：原文里把对称性定义为了一种变换，而不是在某种变换 下不变的性质(a symmetry of the square is a transformation that maps this set of points into itself.)，但是后面又说‘Symmetry means invariance under a transformation’，这里翻译时有些改变。另外后文中不少也 是意译，不妨参考原文阅读。（QZR） 图3.2: 正方形绕中心顺 时针旋转5◦ 3.1 群 23 换个角度看：假如你看了一眼原来的正方形，然后闭上眼睛， 这时有人可能把正方形做了一个变换。如果你睁眼以后不能 分辨这个正方形是否被人变换过，那么这个变换就是个对称 变换。 我们把所有使正方形不变的变换构成的集合称为群。变换参 数(本例中就是旋转角度) 不能任意取值(而是取分立的数)， 这样这个群称为离散群。\n\n2. 另一个例子是使单位圆不变的变换构成的集合。类似地，单 位圆还是一些点构成的集合，对称变换把这个集合映射到它 自身。\n\n单位圆绕圆心旋转任意角度都不变。换言之，变换参数(这 里就是旋转角度) 可以取任意值，因此这个群是连续群。\n\n数学中除了几何图形之外还有好多别事物的都有对称性。例 如，对于向量，我们可以考虑所有让向量长度不变的变换构成的 集合。看出本节开头对称性定义的普遍性了没? 对称性就是变换 下的不变性。非常幸运，搞数学的早已建立了群论，它可以研究所 有类型的对称性2。\n\n为了让描述对称的工具——群——有确切的含义，我们把对 称性的定义用数学语言精炼一下:\n\n• 对某物什么也不做(比如转个0◦) 当然也是对称变换(按照 我们的对称性定义)，因此任何群都需要包含一个恒等变换 (恒等元)。在上面的例子里，恒等元就是旋转0◦。\n\n图3.4: 单位圆旋转的示 意图，单位圆绕圆心旋\n\n• 对某物先做变换再做逆变换的结果必须等于啥也不做。因此 转任意角度都不变 对于群中的任意元素(简称群元)，必须有相应的逆元素。按 定义，先做变换再做逆变换等于恒等变换。例如先转90◦再 2 历史上数学家们建立群论最初 是为了描述方程的对称性 转−90◦(先逆针再顺针转) 与旋转0◦相同。 • 先做一个对称变换再做一个对称变换，总体效果必须还是对 称变换。例如先旋转90◦再转180◦等于直接转270◦，后者 也是对称变换。对称变换的这个性质称为封闭性。 • 对称变换之间必须满足结合律3。例如转90◦再转40◦再转 3 它们不一定满足交换律！例如 绕不同轴的旋转变换之间不能 交换顺序，比如Rx(θ)Rz(ϕ) ̸= Rz(ϕ)Rx(θ) 110◦这种操作，无论是先转130◦再转110◦，还是先转90◦ 再转150◦都一样。用符号表示更加清楚: R(110◦)R(40◦)R(90◦) = R(110◦) \u0012 R(40◦)R(90◦) \u0013 = R(110◦)R(130◦) (3.1) R(110◦)R(40◦)R(90◦) = \u0012 R(110◦)R(40◦) \u0013 R(90◦) = R(150◦)R(90◦) (3.2) 这个性质称为结合律。\n\n24 Chapter 3. Lie 群\n\n• 我们需要了解两个群元(对称变换) 是怎样结合的。这种结 合是个二元运算3，我们称它为群乘法。\n\n4 旋转矩阵见附录A.2。\n\n在上面的例子里，旋转变换的标准表示方法是用旋转矩阵4， 两个群元(两个旋转矩阵，或两个旋转操作) 结合的规则是线性代 数里的矩阵乘法。同样的变换经常有不同的表示方法5，群论非常 5 例如，二维平面旋转还可以用 单位复数描述，相应的群乘法是 复数乘法。稍后就讨论这一点。\n\n系统性地概括了所有形式。群论的分支——表示论就是研究相同 变换的不同描述方式的，我们在3.5节学习表示论。\n\n我们把上述群与对称变换的特征用严谨的数学语言表达，再 将它们提升为公理，满足这些公理的一切数学结构就称为群。必 须指出我们可以搞出超级抽象而又满足群公理的结构，但我们现 在只关注上面例子里的旋转变换那样的群。\n\n讨论完了这些，我们认识到群的抽象定义仅仅是（显然地）蕴 含着这些(我们通过对称变换的性质导出的) 群公理的东西6: 6 别担心怎么才能根据这些公理 凑出一个群来。搞物理的往往是 从某个变换出发，考察它是否符 合群公理，如果是那么就可以应 用群论来解决问题。\n\n一个群是一个集合G，加上一个定义在G 上的二元运算(群 乘法)◦，且要求(G, ◦) 满足以下公理:\n\n• 封闭性: 对于任意g1, g2 ∈G, g1 ◦g2 ∈G • 单位元: 存在单位元e ∈G 使得对于所有g ∈G, g ◦e = g = e ◦g • 逆元: 对于任意g ∈G，存在相应的逆元g−1 ∈G 使得 g ◦g−1 = e = g−1 ◦g\n\n• 结合律: 对于任意g1, g2, g3 ∈G, g1◦(g2◦g3) = (g1◦g2)◦g3 总而言之: 某对象在一些变换下保持不变，所有的这些变换组 7 复习一下，Minkowski 度规就 是在Minkowski 空间中用来计 算距离和长度的工具，见第2章。\n\n成4的集合叫做对称群。对于Minkowski 时空，Minkowski 度规7在 变换下保持不变，相应的对称群称为Poincaré 群。\n\n要注意群的定义完全与变换的对象是啥没有关系。因此我们 可以脱离特定对象而只研究对称变换本身，群的定义将变换从对 象中‘提取’出来了。这是非常有用的，许多不同事物具有同样或 同类的对称性。群论让我们不用管变换的对象5，只研究变换(例 如旋转) 的普遍性质。\n\n3.2 Rotations in two Dimensions 二维旋转 8 当然还有平移。平移的数学描 述与前两者有些不同，我们之后 再讨论它。\n\n我们从一个简单而重要的例子开始学习群论。考虑那些让二 维平面中的向量长度不变的对称变换。符合条件的有旋转和反射8。 它们也是圆的对称变换，一个单位元旋转或反射之后还是单位圆。\n\n可见同一个群（对应一种变换）可以作用于不同类对象：圆（几何 3两个群元结合成一个 4我在想这里该用‘构成’还是‘组成’，后来我觉得无所谓，因为这不是初中 化学⋯⋯(分子构成物质，元素组成物质⋯⋯)——译者(SI) 5译者注：圆还是正方形 3.2 二维旋转 25 图形），或者向量6。本节考虑向量，可以用旋转矩阵表示向量的旋 9 旋转矩阵的推导见附录A.2。\n\n转或反射9，将起点位于原点的向量绕原点逆时针旋转θ 角度的旋 转矩阵为7 Rθ = \u0012cos θ −sin θ sin θ cos θ\n\n\u0013 (3.3) 关于x 轴与y 轴的反射变换用矩阵表示为：\n\n\u0013 Py = \u00121 0 0 −1\n\n\u0013 (3.4) Px = \u0012−1 0 0 1 将矩阵乘法作为群乘法◦, 可以验证对于所有的θ，R(θ), Px, Py 与 矩阵乘法符合群公理，因而构成一个群，亦即旋转与反射变换构 成一个群。 可以用更抽象的方式表达‘所有让二维向量长度不变的变换’， 向量长度就是向量与自身点乘的平方根(|a| = √a · a). 向量长度 在变换a →a′ 下不变意味着8： a′ · a′ != a · a (3.5) 将线性变换对应的矩阵记作O，变换即为a →a′ = Oa. a·a = aT a →a′T a′ = (Oa)T Oa = aT OT Oa != aT a = a·a (3.6) 由此可见，使向量长度不变的变换必须满足9： OT O = I (3.7) 其中I 表示单位矩阵。10。前文的旋转和反射矩阵都满足此条 件112 × 2 矩阵中所有满足(3.7)式的矩阵构成了O(2) 群，即所有 2 × 2 正交矩阵构成的群12。我们可以找出这个群中描述旋转变换 的那一部分（构成一个子群）。根据(3.7)式： 10 det \u0000 OT O \u0001 = det \u0000 OT \u0001 det(O) != det(I) = 1 I = \u00121 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 (det(O))2 != 1 →det{(O)} != ±1 (3.8) 11 例如(3.3)式的矩阵，RT θ R = \u0012cos θ −sin θ sin θ cos θ\n\n\u0013 \u0012 cos θ sin θ −sin θ cos θ\n\n\u0013 = \u0012cos2 θ + sin2 θ 0 0 sin2 θ + cos2 θ det O = 1 的矩阵对应旋转变换13。而条件 OT O = I (3.9)\n\n\u0013 = \u00121 0 0 1 det O = 1 (3.10)\n\n\u0013 定义了SO(2) 群，这里的S 表示‘特殊’(special)，O 表示‘正 12 严谨地说，任意2 × 2 正交矩 阵可以表示为(3.3)、(3.4)式，或 者它们的乘积的形式。\n\n交’(orthogonal)。\n\nSO(2) 包含的旋转变换保持了坐标系的取向，即一个右手坐 标系14经旋转变换后还是右手系，而反射变换会改变它的取向。用 13 见(3.3)与(3.4)式。反射矩阵 的行列式等于−1。\n\n线性代数的概念来说，我们规定SO(2) 中的矩阵行列式必须为 +1。\n\n6可以简单考虑为一个点，其相对于原点就是该向量。——译者注 7译者注：原文此式符号有误。\n\n14 右手坐标系与左手坐标系见 附录A.5。\n\n8等号上面的! 只是起强调、提示作用——译者(SI) 9其中是由于a 任意从而能够得到OT O = I。\n\n26 Chapter 3. Lie 群 3.2.1 Rotations with Unit Complex Numbers 用单位复数表示旋转变 换 还可以用单位复数来表示二维的旋转变换：绕原点旋转θ 角可 以表示为乘以单位复数z（单位复数意为z = a+ib，|z|2 = z∗z = 1） 15 上标∗表示复数的共轭复数： z = a + ib →z∗= a −ib 16U 表示幺正性，它的含义为 U∗U = 1. 15。\n\n所有单位复数构成一个群，称为16 U(1)，群乘法即为复数乘 法，不难验证它符合群公理。为了看出它与之前引入的O(2), SO(2) 群10的关系，我们将U(1) 群的条件——复数的模（长度）为1 表 17 定义中包含复数乘法的群的 普遍性质见3.10节的附录。\n\n示为17，∀U ∈U(1)： U∗U = 1 (3.11) 单位复数另一种写法是18： 18 附录B.4.2推导了传说中的欧 拉公式。对任意复数z = a+ib, a 称为z 的实部，记为Re(z) = a; b 称为虚部，记为Im(z) = b. 欧 拉公式中Rθ 的实部为cos θ, 虚 部为sin θ. Rθ = ei θ = cos θ + i sin θ (3.12) Rθ 的模平方为: R∗ θRθ = e−i θei θ = \u0000 cos θ −i sin θ \u0001\u0000 cos θ + i sin θ \u0001 = 1 (3.13) 例：将向量(3, 5) 对应的复数z = 3 + 5i 旋转90◦： z →z′ = ei 90◦z = \u0012 cos 90◦ | {z } =0 +i sin 90◦ | {z } =1\n\n\u0013 (3+5i) = i(3+5i) = 3i−5 (3.14) 图3.6绘制了旋转前后的向量（复数），图中可见复数乘以ei 90◦ 旋转了90◦. 需要注意ei 90◦作用于（乘以）向量对应的复数而非向量本身。 描述二维旋转只需要一个参数：旋转角ϕ. 而复数有两个自由度（实 部和虚部），因此我们加上单位复数的限制：|z| = 实部2+虚部2 = 1， 图3.5: 单位复数在复平 刚好只剩一个自由度。 描述二维旋转的两种方式——单位复数与2 × 2 矩阵（矩阵元 面的单位圆上 都是实数）通过如下方式相联系。定义： 1 = \u00121 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 , i = \u00120 −1 1 0\n\n\u0013 (3.15) 不难验证这样定义的1, i 仍然满足： 12 = 1, i2 = −1, 1i = i1 = i (3.16) 这样单位复数对应的2 × 2 实数矩阵为11 Rθ = cos θ+i sin θ = cos θ \u00121 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 +sin θ \u00120 −1 1 0\n\n\u0013 = \u0012cos θ −sin θ sin θ cos θ\n\n\u0013 图3.6: 复数通过乘以单 位复数进行旋转 10译者注：原文有误，现已更正 11译者注：原文此式有误，译文已参照勘误表修改。\n\n3.3 三维旋转 27 (3.17) 可见，定义了复单位i →实矩阵的对应关系后，单位复数就回到 了熟悉的旋转矩阵。还有一点要注意：旋转矩阵作用于向量（列矩 阵），而我们将i 与2 × 2 的实矩阵相联系，因此被旋转的向量（与 一个复数对应）也将变成一个2 × 2 矩阵。\n\n例：任意向量(a, b) 对应的复数对应的2 × 2 矩阵为：\n\n\u0013 + b \u00120 −1 1 0\n\n\u0013 = \u0012a −b b a\n\n\u0013 (3.18) z = a + ib = a \u00121 0 0 1 将旋转矩阵作用于z： z′ = \u0012a′ −b′\n\n\u0013 = Rθz = \u0012cos θ −sin θ sin θ cos θ\n\n\u0013 \u0012a −b b a\n\n\u0013 b′ a′\n\n= \u0012a cos θ −b sin θ −b cos θ −a sin θ a sin θ + b cos θ −b sin θ + a cos θ\n\n\u0013 (3.19) 由上式可得 a′ = a cos θ −b sin θ (3.20) b′ = a sin θ + b cos θ (3.21) 这与旋转矩阵作用于向量（列矩阵形式）相同：\n\n\u0012cos θ −sin θ sin θ cos θ\n\n\u0013 \u0012a b\n\n\u0013 = \u0012a cos θ −b sin θ a sin θ + b cos θ\n\n\u0013 = \u0012a′\n\n\u0013 (3.22) b′ 19 如果映射Π : G →G′ 是 一一映射，并且满足：∀g1, g2 ∈ G, Π(g1) ◦Π(g2) = Π(g1 ◦g2), 则Π 就是同构映射，并且称群 G, G′ 是同构的。\n\n我们看到这两种表示方法是一回事儿，用数学术语来说，SO(2) 与 U(1) 间有一个同构映射19。这一点太重要了，之后的篇幅会不断 出现这种思想。\n\n下面研究三维旋转，尝试找出它的两种描述方法20。\n\n20 其中蕴含着十分硬却失挺(interesting) 的内容⋯⋯与二维旋 转类似，我们将找出三维旋转的 第二法，这个第二法能够揭示大 自然更深刻的内容。\n\n3.3 Rotations in three Dimensions 三维旋转 三维向量旋转变换当然可以用3 × 3 旋转矩阵12：\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n cos θ 0 sin θ 0 1 0 −sin θ 0 cos θ\n\n 1 0 0 0 cos θ −sin θ 0 sin θ cos θ\n\n Ry =\n\n Rx =\n\n\n\n\n\n cos θ −sin θ 0 sin θ cos θ 0 0 0 1\n\n Rz = (3.23) 21 基的概念见附录A.1。\n\n类比SO(2) 群，上面三个矩阵构成了SO(3) 群的一组基21。\n\n12原文公式有误，译文已按勘误表改正。\n\n28 Chapter 3.

Lie 群 利用前述四元数的矩阵表示可得： det(v) = x2 + y2 + z2 (3.35) 于是保持向量(x, y, z) 长度不变的变换就对应于保持矩阵行列式 不变的矩阵变换。而单位四元数对应矩阵都具有单位行列式，它 与任意矩阵相乘不改变该矩阵的行列式18。进展很顺利，但现在有 个微妙的状况：继续猜想下去，我们会认为用单位四元数u 旋转 向量（对应的四元数）v 直接用u 乘以v 就可以了（按照四元数 乘法规则）。但细想起来这却不行，因为根据(3.34)式，我们把任 意三维向量对应的四元数定义在Ri + Rj + Rk 的范围内，u 与v 的四元数乘积会超出这个范围，这样向量旋转后可能不是个向量！\n\n这当然不行。 事实上，旋转变换表示为： v′ = q−1vq (3.36) 其中v, v′ 分别为旋转前后的向量，q 为表示旋转的单位四元数。\n\n这样我们终于实现了描述三维旋转的第二法——单位四元数。\n\n例：定义u 是Ri + Rj + Rk 中的某一单位向量，则任意单位 四元数t 可表示为： t = cos θ + u sin θ (3.37) 利用(3.34)式，任意三维向量⃗v 可表示为：\n\n\u0012 ivz vx + ivy −vx + ivy −ivz\n\n\u0013\n\n⃗v = (vx, vy, vz)T = vxi+vyj+vzk = |{z} (3.31)式 (3.38) 简明起见我们举个特例，把向量⃗v = (1, 0, 0)T 绕z 轴旋转。\n\n⃗v = (1, 0, 0)T →v = 1i + 0j + 0k = \u0012 0 1 −1 0\n\n\u0013 (3.39) Rz(θ) = cos θ1 + sin θk = \u0012cos θ + i sin θ 0 0 cos θ −i sin θ\n\n\u0013 (3.40) 上式也可用欧拉公式写出29： eix = cos x + i sin x ⇒Rz(θ) = \u0012eiθ 0 0 e−iθ\n\n\u0013 (3.41) 29 欧拉公式的推导见附录B.4.2 四元数旋转矩阵的逆矩阵为： R−1 z (θ) = \u0012cos θ −i sin θ 0 0 cos θ + i sin θ\n\n\u0013 = \u0012e−iθ 0 0 eiθ\n\n\u0013 (3.42) 18利用det(AB) = det(A) det(B)，——译者 3.3 三维旋转 31 根据(3.36)式旋转向量v；\n\nv′ = R−1 z (θ)vRz(θ) = \u0012e−iθ 0 0 eiθ\n\n\u0013 \u0012 0 1 −1 0\n\n\u0013 \u0012eiθ 0 0 e−iθ\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013 = \u0012 0 cos(2θ) −i sin(2θ) −cos(2θ) −i sin(2θ) 0\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u0012 0 e−i2θ\n\n−ei2θ 0 (3.43) 另一方面，向量v′ 用四元数表示为： v′ = \u0012 iv′ z v′ x + iv′ y −v′ x + iv′ y −iv′ z\n\n\u0013 (3.44) 上式与(3.43)式比较可得： v′ x = cos(2θ), v′ y = −sin(2θ), v′ z = 0 (3.45) 所以\n\n→⃗v′ = \u0000 cos(2θ), −sin(2θ), 0 \u0001T (3.46) 由上式可见从⃗v 到⃗v′ 确实进行了旋转30，但是要注意，上式表示 我们没有把⃗v 旋转θ 角度，而是旋转了2θ！因此我们定义ϕ ≡2θ, 这样ϕ 表示真正的旋转角，(3.37) 重写为： 30 见(3.24)式，那里我们用三维 旋转矩阵旋转向量。\n\nt = cos \u0012ϕ\n\n\u0013 + sin \u0012ϕ\n\n\u0013 u (3.47) 2 2 这样定义的单位四元数与三维旋转矩阵之间的关系并非一一 对应的，而是两个单位四元数描述同一个旋转，例如31： tϕ=π = u tϕ=3π = −u 31 将向量旋转π 与旋转3π = π + 2π 相同。换言之：两个单位 四元数u 与−u 对应同一变换： 旋转π.\n\n@ @ @ @ R\n\n\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 将向量旋转π 因此SU(2) 群称为SO(3) 群的双覆盖。一个SU(2) 中的群元 对应SO(3) 的哪个群元是很明确的，反过来就不行，因为SO(3) 中的一个群元对应SU(2) 中的两个。这并非仅有数学意义，稍后 就会看到，在物理上，一个能覆盖别的群的群往往更加深刻32。\n\n给定某个群，为了找出能覆盖这个群的群，我们需要学习Lie 32 剧透：Lorentz 群的双覆盖 蕴含自旋概念，而Lorentz 群 自身并不具有。自旋是指粒子 的某种内禀角动量，它是粒子 最重要的特征之一。自旋在小 节4.5.4和8.5.5详述。\n\n代数——Lie 理论的利器，下一节就讲Lie 代数。 注意我们把三维向量对应到四元数集Ri + Rj + Rk 中，因此 四元数的一个参数没有用到，这是相对论的伏笔。比如将时间t 考 虑进来后，四维‘向量’与四元数对应的十分自然，就像二维复数 与二维向量之间那样：v = t1 + xi + yj + zk。纯数学的观点鼓励 我们使用4 维向量。如果我们想描述四维旋转（因为我们目前认 为宇宙是3 + 1 四维时空），应该怎么办？有两个选择： 32 Chapter 3. Lie 群\n\n• 再去找更高维的‘复数’，或者：\n\n• 再用四元数试试看。 从刚才的遐想可以看出四元数与四维旋转有着暧昧的联系。任意 33 四维旋转矩阵O(4 × 4) 有 16 个参数，条件OT O = 1 与 det(O) = 1 将16 个参数限制为 6 个自由参数。19 四维旋转需要6 个参数表示33，没有7 维复数，这样‘单位7 维 复数描述6 个参数的四维旋转’就行不通了。我们注意到两个单 位四元数正好有6 个自由参数。因此两个单位四元数很可能可以 描述四维旋转。之后会看到，两个SU(2) 群与四维旋转群确实存 在千丝万缕的联系。\n\n3.4 Lie Algebras Lie 代数 Lie 理论是研究连续对称的理论。连续对称的例子可见本章开 头讨论的单位圆的旋转对称性。连续性意味着存在无限接近于恒 等变换（恒等变换：什么都不干）的群元。相对的，离散群的群元 个数是可数的，不存在无限接近于恒等元的群元。例如把正方形绕 中心转0.000001◦，这与恒等变换（转0◦）非常接近，但它不是正 方形的恒等变换。而把圆绕圆心转0.000001◦就是对称的。圆的对 称群（对称变换组成的群）是连续的，因为变换参数（旋转角）可 以取任意（连续）的值。用数学符号来表示：把恒等元记作I，无 限接近恒等元的群元g 可表示为： g(ϵ) = I + ϵX (3.48) 其中ϵ 表示小量（数学上总是用ϵ 表示小量），X 称为生成元，稍 后就讨论它。这样一个轻微的小变换作用在对象上几乎啥也不变， 有时称g(ϵ) 为无穷小变换。把无穷小变换重复许多次就能得到一 个有限大小的变换。以旋转为例：许多朝同一方向小旋转等效于 一次有限大的旋转。用数学语言来说，我们可以将无穷小变换重 复许多次：\n\n= (I + ϵX)k (3.49) h(θ) = (I + ϵX)(I + ϵX) . . . (I + ϵX) | {z } k个(I+ϵX) 其中k 表示无穷小变换重复的次数。如果θ 表示有限大的旋转角， 比如50◦什么的，然后N 表示超大的数，则无限接近于恒等变换 的旋转变换可表示为： g( θ N ) = I + θ N X (3.50) 要使上式表示的变换尽可能小，则让N 尽可能大，令N →∞。\n\n为了从这样一个无穷小变换得到一个有限变换，需要把无穷小变 换重复无限多次，即：\n\n\u0012 I + θ N X \u0013N (3.51) h(θ) = lim N→∞ 3.4 Lie 代数 33 微积分告诉我们这个极限就是指数函数34：\n\n\u0012 I + θ N X \u0013N = eθX (3.52) h(θ) = lim N→∞ 上式有X 生成了有限变换h(θ) 的感觉，因此X 成为生成元。生 成元的严格定义之后详述，下面先从另一个角度看这个问题。\n\n考虑某个用矩阵表示的连续变换群，对任意群元，在恒等元I 处做Taylor 展开35。\n\n35 如果你从未听说过Taylor 展 开或Taylor 级数，作者推荐你 看一看附录B.3\n\nθ=0 θ + 1\n\nθ=0 θ2 + · · · = X\n\nθ=0 θn 2! d2h dθ2 1 n! dnh dθn h(θ) = I + 1 1! dh dθ n (3.53) 利用指数函数的级数展开可将上式的级数表示为更紧凑的形 36 附录B.4.1中有推导 式36：20\n\nθ=0 θn (3.54) h(θ) = exp \u0012dh\n\nθ=0θ \u0013 ≡ X 1 n! dnh dθn dθ n 这与之前的描述有联系。比较上式与(3.52)式可得：\n\nθ=0 (3.55) X = dh dθ 蕴含在上述推导中的思想是：通过研究群中重要的无穷小元 素——生成元21（上面的X）就能获得群的许多重要信息。\n\n矩阵Lie 群（记作G）的Lie 代数就是下面的集合： n X 若eX ∈G o 即如果X 满足eX 是G 的群元，则X 就是G 的Lie 代数（它是 一个集合！）中的元素。这个简单定义只对矩阵Lie 群管用。之后 我们引入Lie 代数的一般定义。\n\n37 群G 的Lie 代数通常用哥特 体活字（Fraktur）字母g 表示。\n\n上面的矩阵Lie 群的Lie 代数的定义用数学语言表述为37： n × n 矩阵Lie 群G 的Lie 代数g 是满足如下条件的n × n 矩阵X 的集合： etX ∈G, t ∈R 根据群的定义，群无非是一些变换的集合。群乘法◦告诉我们 群元之间怎样结合。矩阵Lie 群的群乘法就是矩阵乘法，我们可能 naive 地认为Lie 代数的元素之间采用相同的方式结合（◦），但这 并不正确！诚然，（矩阵Lie 群的）Lie 代数的元素都是矩阵38，但 38Lie 群理论的著名定理—— Ado 定理（Ado’s Theorem）告 诉我们任意Lie 代数与矩阵Lie 代数同构。\n\n20原文下式有误，译文已按勘误表修改。\n\n21注意生成元X 并非群元，I + ϵX 才是。\n\n34 Chapter 3.

Lie 群 元运算照样满足这些公理，比如经典力学中著名的Poisson 括号26。\n\n注意Lie 代数的抽象定义完全不依赖群，这十分重要哟27。 在下一小节我们推导SU(2) 群的生成元的基（再通过线性组 合就能得到所有生成元），并且我们会看到它与SO(3) 的生成元 满足同样的Lie 括号关系（(3.73)式）。这就是SU(2) 与SO(3) 群有相同Lie 代数的含义。这个超级重要的结论将揭示SU(2) 与 SO(3) 间许多不为人知的关系。\n\n3.4.3 The Generators and Lie Algebra of SU(2) SU(2) 的生成元与 Lie 代数 前面我们历经磨难终于找到描述三维旋转的第二法——SU(2) 群，并且发现SU(2) 是SO(3) 的双覆盖52。\n\n52 复习一下，这意味着两 个SU(2) 中的两个群元对应 SO(3) 群的同一元素。\n\nSU(2) 群的群元是具有单位行列式53的幺正的2×2 矩阵，即： U†U = UU† = 1 (3.75) 53 具有单位行列式正是“特殊” (S) 的含义。\n\ndet(U) = 1 (3.76) 从群元满足的条件可导出其生成元满足的条件。设生成元为 J1, J2, . . . 28，将群元用生成元表示，带入上两式54： 54 前面说过，为了让生成元是厄 米矩阵，我们在e 指数上加了i， 这样可以确保量子力学预言的实 验值为实数。\n\nU†U = (eiJi)†eiJi != 1 (3.77) det(U) = det \u0000 eiJi\u0001 != 1 (3.78) 结合(3.77)式、BCH 公式（(3.56)式）和[Ji, Ji] = 029： (eiJi)†eiJi = e−iJ† i eiJi != 1\n\n→e−iJ† i +iJi+ 1 2 [J† i ,Ji]+... != 1\n\n→ |{z} e0=1 J† i != Ji (3.79) 满足J† i = Ji 的矩阵称为厄米矩阵，由上可见SU(2) 的生成 元必须是厄米的。 利用恒等式det \u0000 eA\u0001 = etr(A)30与(3.78)式可得： det \u0000 eiJi\u0001 = ei tr(Ji) = 1 → |{z} e0=1 tr(Ji) != 0 (3.80) 综上，SU(2) 的生成元一定是无迹的厄米矩阵。2 × 2 无迹厄 米矩阵的一组基为55： 26Poisson 括号可见朗道，力学，高等教育出版社，2007，§42，泊松括号。ISBN： 9787040208498。——译者 552 × 2 复数矩阵有4 个复数元 素，因此有8 个自由度。无迹、 厄米性的条件限制了只剩3 个自 由度。\n\n27但是恐怕仅仅在这个地方读者很难感受到这句话的意义。没事，译者也是很 久之后才领会到的，但是请一定把这句话记住。——译者 28在下面的式子中请注意区分虚数单位i 和表示数字指标的下标i，我们对作 者采用这样的符号很抱歉。——译者 29这由Lie 括号的反对称性导出：[Ji, Ji] = −[Ji, Ji] →[Ji, Ji] = 0，——译者 30可将A 化成上三角矩阵来证明。——译者 3.4 Lie 代数 39\n\n\u0013 , σ3 = \u00121 0 0 −1\n\n\u0013 (3.81)\n\nσ1 = \u00120 1 1 0\n\n\u0013 , σ2 = \u00120 −i i 0 也就是说任意2 × 2 无迹厄米矩阵都可唯一表示为上面三个矩阵 的线性组合。这三个矩阵称为Pauli 矩阵。 把Pauli 矩阵扔进Lie 括号中进行计算可得： [σi, σj] = 2iϵijkσk (3.82) 其中ϵijk 是Levi-Civita 符号。上式右侧的2 很多余，因此通常将 SU(2) 的生成元的基定义为Ji ≡1 2σi，这样Lie 括号计算结果为： [Ji, Jj] = iϵijkJk (3.83) 注意这与SO(3) 的生成元形式（(3.73)式）相同！因此我们说SU(2) 与SO(3) 有相同的Lie 代数，因为Lie 代数是通过Lie 括号定义 的！利用Lie 代数的抽象定义可以用不同的方式描述SU(2) 群对 应的变换，即，SU(2) 群对应的变换可以不用2 × 2 矩阵表示。为 了做到这一点，我们还需要知道Lie 群的抽象定义。因为一直以来 就是用2 × 2 矩阵定义SU(2) 的,（SU‘2’嘛!）换一种表示方法 （例如用3 × 3 矩阵表示）则不知所云。Lie 群的抽象定义能够让 我们发现同一变换的不同表示之间的关系。抽象定义将Lie 群与 一种几何结构——流形相等同，利用这种抽象结构来定义一个群。 这一想法初看十分怪异，但在学习两个例子之后就会发现它是超 级有意义的。\n\n3.4.4 The Abstract Definition of a Lie Group Lie 群的抽象定义 我们讨论过纯良的U(1) 群，它由全体单位复数构成。定义为 z∗z = 1，设z = a + ib，则： z∗z = (a + ib)∗(a + ib) = (a −ib)(a + ib) = a2 + b2 = 1 (3.84) 这也是单位圆的定义条件56。可见单位复数的集合正是复平面上的 56 单位圆记作S1，它是二维空 间中到原点的距离为1 的所有 点构成的集合。用数学语言就是 S1 = {(x1, x2)|x2 1 + x2 2 = 1}￿ 单位圆。此外，我们知道U(1) 与SO(2) 群间存在一一映射57。因 此这两个群可以与几何对象——单位圆——视为等同。群的抽象 定义并非将这个群用SO(2)，或着是不同的U(1) 体现，因为它们 57 严谨的说法是：同构映射。数 学上把两个对象‘相同’称为它 们‘同构’。如果两个对象之间存 在一个同构映射，那么它们就是 同构的。\n\n都是由特定维数的对象定义的。可以将该群直接利用单位圆定义。 即二维旋转变换（对应的Lie 群）等同于单位圆，然后我们可以用 SO(2) 群表示这个变换（2 × 2 矩阵），也可用U(1) 群来表示（单 位复数）。\n\n下面讨论升级版——SO(3) 与SU(2)。前面讲过在SU(2) 与 单位四元数之间有一一映射。单位四元数就是满足下列条件的一 般四元数q = a1 + bi + cj + dk： a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 != 1 (3.85) 40 Chapter 3. Lie 群 这与三维超球面S3 的定义58相同！上式给出了一个SU(2) 与S3 之间的映射，该映射是同构映射（是单射也是满射），因此我们可 以把SU(2) 与三维超球面S3 等同。\n\n59 下面定义里的数学细节不必 在意，本书用不着那些内容。但 必须记住现代定义的灵魂：Lie 群= 流形。\n\n结合上面的例子，Lie 群的现代定义就不难理解了59： Lie 群是一个群，也是一个微分流形60。当然，这个流形要满 足如下条件： 60 流形是满足某些条件的点集， 例如球面就是一个流形，它局部 看起来就像平坦Euclidean 空间 Rn。或者，n 维流形就是满足如 下条件的点的集合：任意一点可 以对应n 个独立坐标。本章末 的3.11节有流形的详细说明。\n\n群乘法◦诱导出的从流形到流形自身的映射必须是可微的31。\n\n这称为相容性条件，它保证了群定义与流形定义的兼容。例如， 群G 的任意群元a 诱导出了从G 到G 的映射：给定∀b ∈G， c ≡a ◦b ∈G，映射a : G →G32必须是可微的。\n\n流形中的任意点都有相应的坐标，可以用坐标的语言表示上 述内容：c = ab 对应的坐标必须是b 的坐标的可微函数。\n\n从Lie 代数的抽象定义可以看出SO(3) 与SU(2) 有相同的 61 本书不讨论这些抽象内容。感 兴趣的读者可以阅读本章末尾的 推荐教材。在这里我们知道一个 Lie 代数总是有一个特别的群就 够了。\n\nLie 代数((3.83)式)，现在有了Lie 群的抽象定义，我们可以填 在3.4节结尾处开的一个坑了： “⋯Lie 理论的一条重要定理告诉我们这其中有一个特 62 这个命题的证明可见Michael Spivak.

Lie 群\n\n• R(e) = I, 恒等元对应的线性变换是恒等变换。\n\n• R(g−1) = \u0000 R(g) \u0001−1, 逆元对应的变换是逆变换。 • R(g) ◦R(h) = R(g ◦h), 群元g, h 结合对应的变换等于他们 分别对应变换的结合。\n\n70 表示的定义可以进行推广，不 一定非得是向量空间（别的空间 也行）上的线性变换（非线性也 可能），拓展后的映射叫realization。物理主要考虑向量空 间中的线性变换（例如量子力学 的Hilbert 空间、狭义相对论的 Minkowski 空间），因此对物理 而言表示比更广泛的realization 更重要。\n\n群的表示70将抽象的群元（群流形上的点）与向量空间中的线 性变换相联系。尽管按定义来讲，表示是个映射，但大多数情况把 表示看做许多矩阵的集合就行了。例如，向量空间71R3 中的旋转 矩阵组成的集合就是SO(3) 群的一个表示，旋转矩阵就是R3 上 的线性变换。注意SO(3) 群对应的变换也可以作用到其他向量空 间。\n\n表示论让我们能系统研究同一个群对不同向量空间的作用，这 71R3 表示三维Euclidean 空间， 它的元素就是三维向量，附录 A.1 里面有很多例子。\n\n让群论变得精彩多了。\n\nSU(2) 是在物理里最常用的群之一。它可以作用到许多向量 空间上，比如作用于一维复数向量空间C1，稍后会看到结果是很 平凡的。再比如作用于C2，下面我们会详细探究这种作用，C2 的 元素是二维复数向量，因此SU(2) 的群元以2 × 2 复数矩阵的形 式出现，这是SU(2) 最常用的表示，之前一直采用此表示。SU(2) 还可作用到C3，前人已经对此有完备的研究，SU(2) 作用于3 维 复向量的时候以3 × 3 矩阵的形式出现。剧透：SU(2) 的C3 版本 的生成元是72：34 72 下一节（3.6.5）就推倒（无 误）它，这里只是为了说明就算 是SU(‘2’)，也可以作用于三维 向量。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 0 −i 0 i 0 −i 0 i 0\n\n 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\n 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −1\n\n, J2 = 1 √\n\n, J3 = 1 √ J1 = 1 √\n\n 2 2 2 (3.87) 把生成元扔进e 指数里就可得到SU(2) 的群元在这个表示之 下对应的矩阵的形式。\n\n上面的路可以一直走到Cn。因此作者纳闷人们为啥叫把这个 73 在作者撰写本书手稿时就把 这个群叫S3，考虑到这个非标准 名字会对初学者造成困扰所以改 了，因为主流教科书都用SU(2)。\n\n群叫SU(2) 而非S3。73但SU(2) 通常定义为满足如下条件的2×2 （是2 哟！）复数矩阵集合(即(3.33)式) U†U = 1, det(U) = 1 (3.88) 下面会把SU(2) 的群元写成3 × 3 矩阵的形式，因此要牢记当谈 论一般情况SU(2) 或其他群群元的时候，我们指的是抽象的群流 形中的点，而非只是2 × 2 矩阵或者别的。\n\n本章前面都是从群的某个表示出发定义一个群的。比如用2×2 矩阵定义SU(2)，此方法的优点是群的含义十分具体。在入门之 后，把群视为抽象流形的观点74更有效，因为这样可以更方便地找 74 例如把SU(2) 视为S3 出其他有用的群表示。\n\n34原文下式J3 的形式有误，译文已按勘误表修改。\n\n3.5 表示论 43 下面定义几个之后要用的概念，它们与表示的“等级”有关 （不是所有表示都是基本的）。 首先是相似变换。给定任意矩阵R 与可逆75矩阵S。则通过 75 矩阵S 可逆的含义是存在矩 阵T 使得ST = TS = 1，S 的 逆矩阵一般记作S−1。\n\n可逆矩阵进行相似变换得到： R →R′ = S−1RS (3.89) 相似变换与表示的关系在于，给定群G，群的表示R(G) 以 及任意可逆矩阵S，则S−1RS 也是群表示。这可以从群的定义直 接看出来：∀g1, g2 ∈G，表示R 把群元映射为向量空间V 上的线 性变换R(g1), R(g2)。群的定义要求： R(g1)R(g2) = R(g1g2) (3.90) 现在把表示进行相似变换： S−1R(g1) SS−1 | {z } =1 R(g2)S = S−1R(g1)R(g2)S = S−1R(g1g2)S (3.91) 上式可得S−1RS 也是一个表示。如果我们有一个表示，那么就能 利用任意可逆矩阵变出好多其他表示，新表示的形式可以更漂亮 （比如让它是对角矩阵）。\n\n第二个概念：不变子空间。给定群G 在向量空间V 上的表示 R，如果V ′ ⊂V 满足：\n\n∀v ∈V ′, g ∈G, 都有R(g)v ∈V ′ 则V ′ 称为V 的不变子空间76。 任意群元作用于V ′ 中的任意向量所得向量仍然在V ′ 内，这 76 自然v ∈V ，子空间V ′ ⊂V ， 换言之V ′ 的任意元素都是V 的 元素。\n\n就可以在V ′ 上定义群G 的表示R′ 了： R′(g)v = R(g)v, ∀v ∈V ′, g ∈G (3.92) 这种情况下，表示R 就有一种不够基本的感觉，它更像是多个小 基本部件所构成的。我们称原来的表示R 不是原来的向量空间V 的基本表示，R‘ 称为子表示。\n\n定义了上述概念之后就能引入超级重要的不可约表示。群G 在向量空间V 上的不可约表示R 意味着除了0 空间和V 自身之 外再无不变子空间。不可约表示是基本的，它们不能再分解为子 表示。利用所有的不可约表示可导出其他所有表示。 还可以从另一个角度看不可约表示：不可约表示不能通过相 似变换变成分块对角矩阵形式。而可约表示能被相似变换变成分 块对角形式。表示的可约性很关键，比如描述基本粒子要用不可 77 要不用啥呢？（译者注：原文 为‘What else?’）\n\n约表示77，基本粒子在变换下的行为由相应对称群的不可约表示描 44 Chapter 3. Lie 群 述。\n\n一个群有许多表示78，怎么知道哪个是描述自然的基本表示？\n\nCasimir 元可以给我们答案。Casimir 元（记作C) 从Lie 代数的 元素——生成元导出，它的定义是，对任意生成元X 都有 [C, X] = 0 (3.93) 79Schur 引理是群论的基本结论 之一，它在任何一本群论书都有。\n\n著名的Schur 引理79告诉我们，给定一个不可约群表示R : g → GL(V )35，如果某个线性变换T : V →V（即T ∈GL(V )）与所有 R(g), ∀g ∈G 对易36，则T 必为恒等变换的常数倍。因此Casimir 元是群表示的‘常数’，这些‘常数’的值自然地为群表示‘编号’ 80 具体内容见下一节的例子。\n\n80。之后我们就从Casimir 元对应编号最低的不可约表示开始。\n\n群表示的定义与向量空间V 有关。一个表示就是将抽象群到 V 的线性变换的映射。线性代数告诉我们以任意矩阵的本征向量 为基可以张成一个向量空间。任意Lie 群的生成元至少有一个可 以通过相似变成对角矩阵81，然后这个对角生成元的本征向量就可 81 对角生成元的集合称为Cartan 子代数，相应的集合元素称 为Cartan 生成元。它们在量子 场论中大放异彩，因为Cartan 生成元的本征值可以给基本粒子 “编号”。例如量子色动力学使用 SU(3) 群，它有两个Cartan 生 成元。因此色动力学描述的粒子 都有两个“编号”。通常不用数 字表示编号，而是用“色”（红、 蓝、绿⋯）来标注。再比如描述 弱相互作用的SU(2) 群只有一 个Cartan 生成元，因此每个粒 子只有一个标签——Cartan 生 成元的本征值。\n\n作为向量空间的基。\n\n下一节导出SU(2) 群的不可约表示。研究SU(2) 是因为 Lorentz 群的Lie 代数是两份SU(2) 的Lie 代数。Lorentz 群是 Poincaré 群的一部分，本章由浅入深对他们逐一讨论。\n\n3.6 SU(2) 特殊幺正群SU(2) 我们在3.4.3小节中用具体的矩阵形式进行计算得到了SU(2) 生成元的Lie 括号82。通过这一点便能得到SU(2) 群的进一步表 示。回到开头我们对SU(2) 群的表示，即2 × 2 的幺正矩阵，其 82 想当年我们就是用这东西抽 象地定义了群的Lie 代数。具体 结果见(3.83)式 行列式的值为1，但这只是一个特例罢了。在进一步处理这个问题 之前，我们可以想一想大概能得到什么样的表示。\n\n3.6.1 The Finite-dimensional Irreducible Representations of SU(2) SU(2) 群的有限维不可约表示 83 我们总是能让一个生成元对 角化。遵从惯例，我们选J3 为 对角阵，由此也生出了矢量空间 的基矢。此外，人们一般都是按 书上的这种方法引入J± 的。\n\n为了知道SU(2) 群有限维不可约表示的一些东西，我们用 在3.4.3小节中出现的算符的线性组合来定义一个新的算符83： J+ = 1 √ 2(J1 + iJ2) (3.94) J−= 1 √ 2(J1 −iJ2) (3.95) 用(3.83)式可以验证新定义的算符满足如下对易关系： [J3, J±] = ±J± (3.96) [J+, J−] = J3. (3.97) 84 即J3v = bv，详见附录C.4。\n\n3.6 SU(2) 45 若v 为J3 本征矢，本征值为b84，用新的算符作用在v 上会得到 很有意思的结果： J3(J±v) = J3(J±v) + J±J3v −J±J3v | {z } =0 = J±J3v | {z } =J±bv\n\n+ J3J±v −J±J3v | {z } =[J3,J±]v = |{z} (3.96)式 (b ± 1)J±v (3.98) 可见J±v 也是J3 的本征矢，本征值为(b ± 1)，记该本征矢为w， 则: J3w = (b ± 1)w 以及 w = J±v (3.99) 算符J−和J+ 通常称为降算符和升算符，也称阶梯算符(ladder operators)。我们可以通过重复利用阶梯算符J± 来得到关 于J3 的本征矢，但这个过程不能无休止地进行，因为不同本征值 的本征矢之间是线性独立的，而我们处理的是有限维的表示。这 意味着相应的矢量空间是有限维的，我们只能得到有限个独立的 矢量。\n\n我们推断一定有一本征矢对应着最大的本征值vmax。若把J+ 作用到v 上N 次以后，得到本征值最大的本征矢vmax vmax = JN + v (3.100) 我们有 J+vmax = 0 (3.101) 因为vmax 已经是有最大本征值的本征矢了。称最大本征值为j := b + N。相应有对应着最小本征值的本征矢vmin，满足 J−vmin = 0 (3.102) 把J−作用到vmax 上M 次以后，得到本征值最小的本征矢vmin vmin = JM −vmax (3.103) 因此，vmin 对应的本征值为j −M。为进一步讨论，我们需要知 道J± 作用到本征矢上的具体形式。上述的计算说明，J−vk 应等 于vk−1 乘上一常数： J−vk = αkvk−1 (3.104) 85 见 Matthew Robinson. Symmetry and the Standard Model. 第90 页,Springer, 1st edition, August 2011. ISBN 978-1-4419-8267-4. 如果非要深究J−作用到vmax 上的细节的话，那我只能告诉你85 35GL(V ) 表示向量空间V 上所有线性变换组成的集合。\n\n36即∀g ∈G, [R(g), T] = 0。\n\n46 Chapter 3. Lie 群\n\nα 满足 p\n\nαj−k = 1 √ (2j −k)(k + 1) (3.105) 2 注意到当k = 2j 时α 为0，因此，经过2j 步之后，我们从梯子 的顶端到达了底端。vmin 的本征值即是j −2j = −j。总的来说， 我们得到了2j + 1 个本征态的本征值\n\n{−j, −j + 1, . . . , j −1, j} (3.106) 此式仅当j 为整数或半整数86时成立。因为我们有2j + 1 个线性 独立的本征矢，故矢量空间应为2j + 1 维87。这些J3 的本征矢 86 不信的话你就用分数试试看！\n\n87 见此书189 页：Nadir Jeevanjee. An Introduction to Tensors and Group Theory for Physicists. Birkhaeuser, 1st edition, August 2011. ISBN 978- 0817647148 构成了完备的矢量空间，因为J1 和J2 能够被J+ 和J−线性表 示，就算是一个任意的线性组合P i aivi 也能变换成另一种线性组 合P i bivi，其中ai, bi 是常数。因此，J3 的本征矢构成了V 的一 个非平庸不变子空间，而我们也在寻找能构成完备矢量空间V 的 不可约表示。\n\n我们可以利用上面定义的2j + 1 维的矢量空间及J3 的本征 矢vk 来给出SU(2) 的一个表示。进一步说，我们能证明SU(2) 的每一种不可约表示都等价于这一种88。\n\n88 例如此书190 页：Nadir Jeevanjee.

ISBN 978- 0817647148 89 回想一下，Casimir 算符指的 是那些与群中每个生成元都对易 的群元，即[C, X] = 0。\n\n3.6.2 The Casimir Operator of SU(2) SU(2) 的Casimir 算符 如第3.5节所述，我们可以用Casimir 算符来标记不同的群表 示。SU(2) 恰好有一个Casimir 算符89： J2 := (J1)2 + (J2)2 + (J3)2 (3.107) 满足定义的条件： [J2, Ji] = 0 (3.108) 我们可以用(3.95)式和(3.94)式定义的J± 来重新表示J2： J2 = J+J−+ J−J+ + (J3)2\n\n= 1 2(J1 + iJ2)(J1 −iJ2) + 1 2(J1 −iJ2)(J1 + iJ2) + (J3)2\n\n= 1 2((J1)2 −iJ1J2 + iJ2J1 + (J2)2) + 1 2((J1)2 + iJ1J2 −iJ2J1 + (J2)2) 90 这些东西只是一些归一化常 数，如果我们将J± 作用到归一 态上，得到的结果一般都不是归 一化的。然而，学物理的都喜欢 用归一态，详细的原因以后再谈。 这些常数的推导有些无聊，大体 思路是先假设c 是个归一化常 数，然后从J±vk = cvk±1 开 始。计算过程能在大多数的量子 力学教材中找到(讲角动量和角 动量算符那块儿)。如果你不知道 也没关系，因为这节讲的对接下 来要讲的东西不是太重要。\n\n+(J3)2\n\n= (J1)2 + (J2)2 + (J3)2 ✓ (3.109) 带入90 p J+vk = 1 √ (j + k + 1)(j −k)vk+1 (3.110) 2 以及 p J−vk = 1 √ (j + k)(j −k + 1)vk−1 (3.111) 2 3.6 SU(2) 47 我们就能计算对于每个表示都成立的系数37： J2vk = (J+J−+ J−J+ + (J3)2)vk\n\n= J+J−vk + J−J+vk + (J3)2vk p p (j + k)(j −k + 1)vk−1 + J− 1 √\n\n= J+ 1 √ (j + k + 1)(j −k)vk+1 + k2vk 2 2 p p\n\n= 1 √ (j + k)(j −k + 1)J+vk−1 + 1 √ (j + k + 1)(j −k)J−vk+1 + k2vk 2 2 p p\n\n= 1 √ (j + k)(j −k + 1) 1 √ (j + (k −1) + 1)(j −(k −1))vk 2 2 p p\n\n+ 1 √ (j + k + 1)(j −k) 1 √ (j + (k + 1))(j −(k + 1) + 1)vk + k2vk 2 2\n\n= 1 2(j + k)(j −k + 1)vk + 1 2(j −k)(j + k + 1)vk + k2vk\n\n= (j2 + j)vk = j(j + 1)vk (3.112) 现在会看这种表示下的几个特例，当然，从最简单的低维数情况 开始。\n\n3.6.3 The Representation of SU(2) in one Dimension SU(2) 的一维 表示 j 的最小可能值为0，这样群的表示是一2j +1 = 2·0+1 = 1 维矢量空间。可以看出这个表示是平庸的，因为只有1 × 1 矩阵满 足SU(2) 李代数的对易关系[Jl, Jm] = iεlmnJn = 0。而生成元0 的指数映射得到的是变换U = e0 = 1，即群的恒等元。\n\n3.6.4 The Representation of SU(2) in two Dimension SU(2) 的二维 表示 接下来我们讨论j = 1 2 的情况，这个表示是2j+1 = 2· 1 2 +1 = 2 维的。群的生成元J3 的本征值为1 2 和1 2 −1 = −1 2，正如从(3.106) 式中所见，因此J3 可表示为\n\n\u0013 (3.113)\n\n\u0012 1 0 0 −1 J3 = 1 2 此处我们选择J3 为对角化的生成元91。对应其本征值+1 2 和−1 91 由于对易关系，SU(2) 群仅有 一个对角化的生成元。还有就是 记住我们可以用相似变换把一个 不对角的生成元变成对角的。\n\n2 的本征矢为： 2 = \u0012 1 0\n\n\u0013 以及 v−1 2 = \u0012 0 1\n\n\u0013 (3.114) v 1 可以用在这一基矢下的阶梯算符来得到SU(2) 另外两个生成 元的矩阵形式 J1 = 1 √ 2(J−+ J+) (3.115) 37原文下式有误，译文已按勘误表修改。\n\n48 Chapter 3. Lie 群 J2 = i √ 2(J−−J+) (3.116) 这一点可以直接从(3.95)式和(3.94)式关于J± 的定义的得到。回 忆一下，表示空间中的基矢是由J3 的本征矢给出的，而我们也基 矢给出用J1, J2。换句话说，J1, J2 是由它们作用在J3 的本征矢 上的效果来定义的。例如 2 = 1 √ 2 = 1 √\n\n) = 1 √ 2 = 1 J1v 1 2(J−+J+)v 1 2(J−v 1 2 +J+v 1 2J−v 1 2v−1 2 | {z } =0 2 (3.117) 2 = 0，因为1 2 是最大的本征值。最后结果的系数1 式中用到J+v 1 2 是从(3.105)式得到的。同理可得 2 = 1 √ 2 = 1 2 (3.118) 2(J−+ J+)v−1 2v−1 J1v−1 2 = (0, 1)T ，因此J1 的矩阵为： 2 = (1, 0)T 和v−1 而我们之前得到的基矢是v 1\n\n\u0012 0 1 1 0\n\n\u0013 (3.119) J1 = 1 2 可以验证上式满足我们所说的J1 作用到基矢上的效果92。同理可 得 92 推导出的(3.117)式为 J1v 1\n\n\u0012 0 −i i 0\n\n\u0013 (3.120) 2 = 1 2 v−1 2 。带入这里具 J2 = 1 体的矩阵形式可得J1v 1 2 =\n\n\u0012 0 1 1 0\n\n\u0013 \u0012 1 0\n\n\u0013 = 2 1 2\n\n\u0012 0 1\n\n\u0013 = 1 正如我们在这一章开头寻找SU(2) 群Lie 代数时所发现的一样 ((3.81)式)，这些生成元Ji = 1 2 √。\n\n1 2 2 v−1 2σi 正是Pauli 矩阵。可以看出，现 在使用表示的是二维表示。当然除此之外还有其他的表示形式，例 如我们下节会看到的三维空间中的表示93。\n\n93 再次说明，SU(2) 最开始的定 义是全体行列式值为1 的2 × 2 幺正矩阵的集合，而在这儿我们 采用抽象的定义，即其对应的流 形S3，接下来还要讨论这个群 的更高维表示，比如3 × 3 矩阵 的表示。其实叫成别的名字可能 更合适(比如说对应的流形S3)， 但按照传统，它就叫SU(2). 3.6.5 The Representation of SU(2) in two Dimension SU(2) 的三维 表示 重复与二维情况相似的操作94 可以得到38：\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 0 −i 0 i 0 −i 0 i 0\n\n 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\n 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −1\n\nJ2 = 1 √ J1 = 1 √\n\nJ3 =\n\n 2 2 94 仍然是从对角化的生成元J3 出发。J3 的本征值为(1,0,-1)，因 此立刻就能得到其矩阵形式。对 于J1, J2 而言，仍然是从其作用 结果出发，即把他们写成J± 的 线性组合然后作用到J3 的本征 矢上。\n\n(3.121) 这就是SU(2) 的三维表示。如果你有兴趣的话，还可以推出三维 表示下SU(2) 群元的形式(把生成元扔进e 指数里)。介于现在所 学已足够理解最重要的Lorentz 群的表示，我们将不会推导更高 维的SU(2) 表示。\n\n38原文下式J3 的形式有误，译文已按勘误表修改。\n\n3.7 Lorentz 群 49 3.7 The Lorentz Group O(1, 3) Lorentz 群O(1, 3) 抽象总是从具体的现实中产生的. . . 你总得从某件事 物出发，最后才能把所有现实的痕迹抹除掉。\n\n95 引自 Robert S.

ISBN 9780618127450\n\n— Pablo Picasso95 本节从Lorentz 群一种常用的表示出发导出相应的Lie 代数。 推导过程与之前SU(2) 的情形相同——用SU(2) 的2 × 2 矩阵表 示导出了Lie 代数。我们会发现Lorentz 群的Lie 代数可以用两份 SU(2) Lie 代数表示，这会导出Lorentz 群的更多表示。著名的向 量表示——即Lorentz 群群元为4 × 4 矩阵，作用于4 维向量—— 仅仅是众多表示中的一种。新表示能描述向量表示不能描述的物 理系统。这就是Lie 理论的威力所在，它使我们找出对称性隐藏的 抽象结构，从而可以描述自然最基本的层面。\n\n首先导出Lorentz 群及其子群的特性。Lorentz 群定义为Minkowski 96 下式的推导在第2 章。重复 一下，Lorentz 群的定义借鉴了 Euclidean 空间中旋转、反射变 换保证Euclidean 空间中内积不 变的特性。\n\n空间中所有保证内积不变的变换组成的集合96： xµxµ = xµηµνxν = (x0)2 −(x1)2 −(x2)2 −(x3)2 (3.122) 其中ηµν 表示Minkowski 度规：\n\n\n\n 1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1\n\n  \n\n   (3.123)\n\nηµν = 这也就是我们把Lorentz 群叫做O(1, 3) 的原因，类似地，群 O(4) 就是保持内积(x0)2 + (x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3)2 的群。这个定义 的条件对变换（矩阵）有什么限制？Lorentz 群的群元——Lorentz 变换通常记作Λ，考虑变换xµ →x′µ = Λµ νxν，变换前后的内积 为： xµηµνxν →x′σησρx′ρ = (xµΛσ µ)ησρ(Λρ νxν) != xµηµνxν (3.124) 由xµ 的任意性可得：\n\nΛσ µησρΛρ ν != ηµν (3.125) 97 复习：两个向量的内积用矩阵 乘法表示是，左侧的向量转置成 行矩阵。因此下式左侧有ΛT 。\n\n上式写成矩阵形式97：\n\nΛT ηΛ != η (3.126) 上式就是Lorentz 变换Λ 定义的数学形式！对上式取行列式，利 用det(AB) = det(A) det(B) 可得：\n\n→det(Λ)2 != 1 (3.127) det(Λ) = det(η) | {z } =−1 det(Λ) det(η) | {z } =−1 50 Chapter 3. Lie 群\n\n→det(Λ) != ±1 (3.128) 取(3.125)式的µ = ν = 0 分量98：\n\nΛσ 0ησρΛρ 0 != η00 |{z} =1\n\n→Λσ 0ησρΛρ 0 = (Λ0 0)2 − X i (Λi 0)2 != 1 (3.129) 由此可得：\n\nΛ0 0 != ± s 1 + X i (Λi 0)2 (3.130) 根据(3.128)与(3.130)式的正负可以把Lorentz 群分成4 分支。\n\n99 这意味着右手坐标系在变换 后仍为右手系，左手坐标系在变 换后仍为左手系。左手、右手坐 标系的定义见附录A.5 保证坐标系取向99不变的两个分支满足det(Λ) = +1. 如果想保证 时间轴的方向不变，则需要条件Λ0 0 ≥0，因为 x0 = t →x′0 = t′ = Λ0 νxν = Λ0 0t+Λ0 1x1 +Λ0 2x2 +Λ0 3x3 (3.131) 如果Λ0 0 ≥0, 则t′ 与t 同号。\n\n满足det(Λ) ≥0 与Λ0 0 ≥0 的分支称为SO(1, 3)↑。我们主要 研究这个子群，它的名字很漂亮——正规100或正时101Lorentz 群。\n\n100‘正规’(proper) 意思是 SO(1, 3)↑子群的群元都是保证 坐标系取向和宇称不变的变换。\n\nLorentz 群的这四分支是分离的，因为从一个分支出发，仅用该分 101‘正时’(orthochronous) 是 指子群的群元保持时间轴的方向 不变。\n\n支的Lorentz 变换无法得到其他任何分支的元素。但引入两个新 变换之后就可以从SO(1, 3)↑出发得到其他分支102：\n\n\n\n 102 在现在的群表示下这两个算 符的矩阵长这样。后面换用不同 的表示，它们会大不一样。\n\n1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1\n\n  \n\n   (3.132)\n\nΛP =\n\n\n\n\n\n−1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1\n\n  \n\n   (3.133)\n\nΛT =\n\nΛP 称为宇称算符，相应的宇称变换其实就是镜面反射。ΛT 称为 时间反演算符。\n\n于是完整的Lorentz 群O(1, 3) 可以表示为如下集合： O(1, 3) = {SO(1, 3)↑, ΛP SO(1, 3)↑, ΛT SO(1, 3)↑, ΛP ΛT SO(1, 3)↑} (3.134) 这样，研究Lorentz 群的表示就可简化为研究SO(1, 3)↑的表 示，因为只要再找出ΛP 、ΛT 的表示，Lorentz 群的其他分支就都 有啦。\n\n3.7 Lorentz 群 51 3.7.1 One Representation of the Lorentz Group Lorentz 群的1 表 示 下面利用Lorentz 群的定义（(3.125)式）构造Lorentz 变换的 显式矩阵表示。首先考虑矩阵的形式。对Lorentz 群，它的群元作 103 通常狭义相对论涉及的向量 空间是四维实Minkowski 空间 R(1,3)。Lorentz 群就是定义在 这个空间的（Lorentz 变换就是 保证4 × 4 度规不变的变换），因 此首先研究群在R(1,3) 上的表 示。类似地，SU(2) 群起初是用 2 × 2 复数矩阵表示的，从那里 出发可以得到SU(2) 好多其他 的表示。\n\n用于4 向量103，因此群元的形式为4 × 4 实数矩阵。矩阵元必须 是实数，因为Minkowski 空间R(1,3) 是实数空间。一般的4 × 4 实数矩阵有16 个参数，而Lorentz 群的定义规定了10 个条件104， 这样还剩6 个自由参数。也就是说描述最一般的Lorentz 变换需 要6 个参数。因此只要集齐6 个线性无关的生成元，就可以召唤 Lorentz 群的Lie 代数。这6 个生成元构成Lie 代数的一组基，即 任意生成元可唯一地表示为它们的线性组合。然后就能计算这些 104 自行验证ΛT ηΛ = η 对Λ 的限制条件是10 个。\n\n基在Lie 括号下的运算结果，从而导出Lie 代数的抽象定义。\n\n注意三维Euclidean 空间中的旋转矩阵（它们只变换空间坐 标而不管时间）满足定义(3.125)式。这是因为Minkowski 度规的 105 空间部分是指分量µ = 1, 2, 3 对应的部分。空间部分通 常记作ηij, 人们习惯用拉丁字母 （例如i, j）表示从1 到3, 而希 腊字母（例如µ, ν）表示从0 到 3。 106η11 = η22 = η33 = −1, ηij = 0, 若i ̸= j 空间部分105与3 × 3 单位矩阵成比例106。因此对于只涉及空间坐 标的变换，由(3.125)可得：\n\n−RT I3×3R = −RT R != −I3×3\n\n→RT I3×3R = RT R != I3×3 上式正是O(3) 群的定义式。再加上条件 det(Λ) != 1 就是SO(3) 群的定义。只涉及空间坐标的Lorentz 变换的形式为：\n\n\u0013\n\nΛrot = \u00121 R3×3 其中旋转矩阵R3×3 的形式见(3.23)式，相关推导见3.4.1节。相应 的生成元的推导与3.4.1节相似，结果为： Ji = \u00120 J3dim i\n\n\u0013 , i = 1, 2, 3. (3.135) 比如，由(3.65)式可得：\n\n\n\n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 1 0\n\n\u0013 = J1 = \u00120 J3dim 1\n\n  \n\n   (3.136) 107Kronecker δ 符号定义为 ( 1, µ = ρ 0, µ ̸= ρ 下面包含时空坐标的变换。按Lie 理论的套路，考虑无穷小变 换107：\n\nδµ ρ = 将Kronecker δ 符号写成矩阵形 式就是恒等矩阵I.\n\nΛµ ρ ≈δµ ρ + ϵKµ ρ (3.137) 52 Chapter 3.

Lie 群 理论告诉我们，对于非单连通群，不存在Lie 代数的不可约表示 和群的表示之间的一一映射119。通过推导Lorentz 群Lie 代数 的不可约表示，可以导出Lorentz 群的覆盖群的不可约表示，只 要把相应的生成元扔进e 指数里就行了。这样导出的一部分表示 是Lorentz 群的表示，还有一些不是。这些额外的表示很有用处， 它们可以用来描述某些基本粒子。 简明起见，我们把之后要推导的Lorentz 群Lie 代数的表示， 或者Lorentz 群双覆盖的表示，全部简称为Lorentz 群的表示。\n\nSU(2) 的每一不可约表示都可以用SU(2) 的Casimir 算符 对应的标量j 来标记。因此Lorentz 群覆盖群120的不可约表示 120Lorentz 群的覆盖群记作 SL(2, C)，它是具有单位行列 式（行列式为1）的2 × 2 复 数矩阵的集合。SL(2, C) → SO(1, 3) 之间的关系与之前讨 论的SU(2) →SO(3) 之间的关 系类似。\n\n可以用两个数j1, j2（它们都是整数或半整数）来标记。下面依次 研究Lorentz 群的(j1, j2) 表示，并利用前面导出的SU(2) 群的 j1, j2 = 0, 1 2, 1, . . . 表示的形式。\n\nLorentz 群的Lie 代数可以用Mµν 表示为更紧凑的形式，Mµν 的定义为： Ji = 1 2ϵijkMjk (3.165) Ki = M0i (3.166) 这样Lie 代数可表示为： [Mµν, Mρσ] = i(ηµρMνσ −ηµσMνρ −ηνρMµσ +ηνσMµρ) (3.167) 下面从Lorentz 群的Lie 代数构造不可约表示，さ、いくぞ！\n\n3.7.4 The (0, 0) Representation (0, 0) 表示 SU(2) 的最低阶表示是平凡的，因为Lie 代数对应是1 维的 向量空间，因此生成元必须是1 × 1 矩阵，满足对易关系的只有平 凡的0: N+ i = N− i = 0 →eN+ i = eN− i = e0 = 1 (3.168) 因此Lorentz 群的(0, 0) 表示作用于在Lorentz 变换下不变的对 象。(0, 0) 表示又称为Lorentz 标量表示。\n\n2, 0) Representation (1 3.7.5 The (1 2, 0) 表示 2, 0) 表示就是对SU(2) 的一份Lie 代数N+ i 使用2 维表 示121，另一份Lie 代数N− i 使用1 维表示，即N− i = 0。由N− i 的定义式(3.161)可得： (1 121 复习：表示对应的向量空间 的维数是2j + 1，因此j = 1/2 表示对应2 × 1 2 + 1 = 2 维向量 空间。\n\nN− i = 1 2(Ji −iKi) = 0 (3.169) 40注意区分之后式子中的虚数单位i 与指标i，我们对作者采用这样的符号很 抱歉。\n\n3.7 Lorentz 群 57\n\n→Ji = iKi (3.170) 此外，根据3.6.4节中导出的SU(2) 的2 维表示的形式： N+ i = σi 2 (3.171) 其中σi 表示Pauli 矩阵，其定义见(3.81)式。 另一方面： 1 2(Ji + iKi) = |{z} (3.170)式 1 2(iKi + iKi) = iKi (3.172) N+ i = |{z} (3.161)式 比较(3.171)与(3.172)式可得： 2 →Ki = σi 2i = iσi iKi = σi 2i2 = −i 2σi (3.173) (3.170)式→Ji = iKi = −i2 2 σi = 1 2σi (3.174) 于是在这一表示下，Lorentz 旋转变换为：41 R⃗θ = ei⃗θ ⃗J = ei⃗θ ⃗σ 2 (3.175) Lorentz 推动变换为42： B⃗ϕ = ei⃗ϕ ⃗K = e ⃗ϕ ⃗σ 2 (3.176) 将生成元扔进e 指数函数里，再将e 指数函数用级数展开，就可 以算出Lorentz 群元的表示。例如，绕x 轴的旋转变换为：\n\n\u00132 +· · ·+ 1\n\n\u0013n +. . .\n\n\u0012 i\n\n\u0012 i 2 σ1 = 1+ i 2θσ1+ 1 Rx(θ) = eiθJ1 = eiθ 1 2θσ1 2θσ1 2!\n\nn!\n\n(3.177) 将σ1 的显式形式（(3.81)式）代入，并利用σ2 1 = 1 可得122： 122 具体过程与3.4.1中的推导十 分相似。\n\nRx(θ) = \u00121 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 + i 2θ \u00120 1 1 0\n\n\u0013 −1\n\n\u0012θ\n\n\u00132 \u00121 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 + . . . 2 2\n\n= \u0012 cos θ\n\n\u0013 2 i sin θ 2 i sin θ (3.178) 2 cos θ 123 之后会看到这些二分量对象 与自旋向上和自旋向下的状态有 关。\n\n2 关于其他轴的旋转及推动变换可类似地导出。注意Lorentz 变换 124 这个名字在引入右手旋量之 后的含义会更清楚。我们会看到 宇称变换将左手旋量变换为右手 旋量，反之亦然。旋量通常分为 左手和右手的，它们的起源与螺 旋性有关——螺旋性与手性不完 全相同。重复一遍宇称算符的效 果：将左手坐标系变换为右手坐 标系，反之亦然。左手、右手旋 量的名字就是从那儿来的。\n\n在这儿用2 × 2 复矩阵表示，它们当然不是作用在Minkowski 空 间的（Minkowski 空间的元素是4 维向量）。Lorentz 变换在(1 2, 0) 表示下作用的2 分量123对象称为左手旋量124：\n\nχL = \u0012(χL)1 (χL)2\n\n\u0013 (3.179) 旋量在这里指的是2 分量对象。左手旋量的另一种定义是在 Lorentz 变换下根据Lorentz 群的(1 2, 0) 表示变换的对象。注意旋 58 Chapter 3. Lie 群 量并不只是2 分量的向量，旋量有很多新的性质。比如e 指数中 的1 2 因子，这个因子使得旋量125在旋转2π 之后不再和原来相同， 而多了一个负号。这个性质十分奇特，因为日常遇到的对象在转 2π 之后总是和原来一样。\n\n“旋量可以说是Lorentz 变换最基本的数学对象。”\n\n— A. M. Steane126 126 Andrew M.

Lie 群 (3.207) 可见这样的左手旋量与右手旋量结合的项并非Lorentz 不变量。\n\n综上，Lorentz 不变量必须是一对同类上下标组合成的量133。或 者，不变量必须是右手旋量的厄米共轭左乘左手旋量：χ† RχL = 133 即上下标都带点 ˙a ˙a 或都不 带点 a a (χ∗ R)T χL ˆ=(χa)T χa，或者左手旋量的厄米共轭左乘右手旋量：χ† LχR = (χ∗ L)T χR ˆ=(χ˙a)T χ˙a。Lorentz 不变量是之后推导的自然界的普适定 律的关键。\n\n在上述基础上，ϵab 的名字“旋量度规”就变得合情合理了，因 为旋量间的内积（在Lorentz 变换下不变，见(3.206)式）可以写为：\n\nχT a χa = |{z} (3.196)式 χT a ϵabχb (3.208) 与第二章Minkowski 空间的内积（它是Lorentz 变换的不变量）的 定义式(2.31)相对比： xµyµ = xµηµνyν (3.209) 其中ηµν 是Minkowski 度规。可见旋量度规与四维向量的Minkowski 度规地位相同134。\n\n在定义了上述符号之后，不难写出旋量度规的下标形式： 134 为啥上式（四维向量的内积 的定义式）当中没有转置操作？其 实上式既可以看做向量方程也可 视为分量方程，符号xµ 既代表 向量本身又代表向量的分量，不 幸的是这有时会造成混乱，比如 现在。将上式看做分量方程，则 无需转置，这对旋量内积也一样。 然而转置运算不可或缺，为了避 免遗忘，我们在旋量内积的定义 式中加上上标 T 表示强调。对 于常用的三维向量有更好的符号 避免上述混乱：向量自身用⃗a，向 量分量用ai 表示。\n\nϵab = \u00120 −1 1 0\n\n\u0013 (3.210) 因为只有用(−ϵ) 才能把χR 转换为χL。135,45 一般的Lorentz 变 换（转动+ 推动）通常用Λ 表示，当Λ 的指标带点，说明它作用 于右手旋量，并由此推断相应的具体形式：\n\nχR →χ′ R = χ′˙a = Λ˙a ˙bχ ˙b = \u0000 ei⃗θ ⃗σ 2 \u0001˙a ˙bχ ˙b (3.211) 2 −⃗ϕ ⃗σ 同理，左手旋量情形： 2 \u0001 b a χb (3.212)\n\nχL →χ′ L = χ′ a = Λb aχb = \u0000 ei⃗θ ⃗σ 2 +⃗ϕ ⃗σ 135 读者可自行检验，但这对之 后的内容关系不大。\n\n这样(1 2, 0) 与(0, 1 2) 表示下的Lorentz 变换记作： 2 ,0) = \u0000 ei⃗θ ⃗σ 2 \u0001b a ˆ=Λ b a (3.213) 2 +⃗ϕ ⃗σ\n\nΛ( 1 2 ) = \u0000 ei⃗θ ⃗σ 2 \u0001b a ˆ=Λ˙a ˙b (3.214) 2 −⃗ϕ ⃗σ\n\nΛ(0, 1 Van der Waerden 符号非常便捷，它有效地体现了χL 与χR 之间 的联系。左右旋量之间可以互相变换，因此必然需要一套能将它 们联系起来的符号体系。\n\n之后考虑下一个不可约表示，有一位故人正在那里久候。\n\n45根据(3.198)，χR = ϵχ∗ L，取共轭得到χ∗ R = ϵχL，再同时左乘ϵ−1 = −ϵ 得 到 (−ϵ)χ∗ R = ϵ−1ϵχL = χL 3.7 Lorentz 群 63 3.7.8 The (1 2, 1 2) Representation (1 2, 1 2) 表示 2) 表示之下，两份SU(2) Lie 代数136N+ i , N− i 都采 136 数学上记作 ( 1 在(1 2, 1 2 , 1 2 ) = ( 1 2 , 0) ⊗(0, 1 2 ). 用2 维表示。首先考虑此表示下的Lorentz 变换作用的对象是什 么。两份Lie 代数之间无相互作用，因为N+ i , N− i 是对易的，即 [N+ i , N− i ] = 0。因此作用的对象（记作v）在两份Lie 代数下各自 独立变换。v 有两个指标v˙b a，每个指标在独立的SU(2) Lie 代数 下变换。v˙b a 即采用了上节介绍的Van der Waerden 符号。\n\n2)，46 因为每个表示都是 v˙b a 的每个指标有两个取值(1 2 和−1 2 维的，v 共有4 个分量。因此v 可表示为2 × 2 矩阵，但v 也可 以表示为四维向量，稍后会看到137。\n\n137 在之前的二维旋转中遇到过 类似情况，二维旋转操作可以用 单位复数作用到向量对应的复数 上来表示，在定义了复数与实数 矩阵间的映射后，旋转也可以用 实矩阵作用于列向量来表示。\n\n首先考虑复数矩阵，一个一般的2 × 2 复数矩阵有4 个复数 元素，因此有8 个自由参数。而据前所述我们只需要4 个自由参 数。任意复矩阵M 可表示为厄米矩阵H(H† = H) 与反厄米矩阵 A (A† = −A) 之和：M = H + A。2 × 2 厄米矩阵和反厄米矩阵都 2, 1 有4 个自由参数。此外，下面会证明厄米矩阵经(1 2) 表示下的 Lorentz 变换后仍为厄米矩阵，反厄米矩阵也一样。这意味着厄米 矩阵与反厄米矩阵分别组成的集合都是不变子空间（见3.5节），亦 即，一般的2 × 2 复矩阵上的表示是可约的。综上所述，下面研究 2 × 2 厄米矩阵（组成的向量空间）上的不可约表示。\n\n138 它的含义是任意2 × 2 厄米 矩阵可以唯一地表示为基的线性 组合：a01 + aiσi。\n\n2 × 2 厄米矩阵的一组基138是Pauli 矩阵139σi, i = 1, 2, 3 加上 单位矩阵。\n\n139 定义见(3.81)式。\n\n首先考虑va˙b，而非v˙b a，这样可以利用(3.81)式的Pauli 矩阵 的显式形式。注意v˙b a, va˙b 之间可用旋量度规ϵ ˙bc 相互变换，因此 容易从v˙b a 回到va˙b。\n\n记σ0 = I2×2 = \u00121 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 ，有47\n\n\u0013\n\n\u00120 1 1 0\n\n\u0013 +v2\n\n\u00120 −i i 0\n\n\u0013 +v3\n\n\u00121 0 0 −1\n\n\u0013 +v1\n\n\u00121 0 0 1 va˙b = vνσν a˙b = v0 (3.215) 140 这仅是基的选取问题，这里 借助Pauli 矩阵来选取具有我们 之前导出的关于向量变换性质的 基底。\n\n上面解释过，我们也可以使用140v˙b a = vµσµ a˙cϵ ˙bc，这样的话选用的 基就是(˜σ˙b a)µ = σµ a˙cϵ ˙bc。48一般的厄米矩阵表示为： va˙b = \u0012 v0 + v3 v1 −iv2 v1 + iv2 v0 −v3\n\n\u0013 (3.216) 上节讲过，不同类的指标按不同方式变换，具体来说：带点的下标 与不带点的下标变换方式不同。\n\n46似乎指标应该为1, 2 ?——译者 47原文下式等号右侧的v 应为下指标，译文已改正。\n\n48原文该式有误，译文已按勘误表修改。\n\n64 Chapter 3.

Lie 群 由此可见在宇称变换之下N+ ↔N−。因此(0, 1 2) 表示下的Lorentz 变换经宇称变换之后变成(1 2, 0) 表示下的变换，反之亦然。这就是 左手、右手旋量名字的来历149。就像右手坐标系在宇称变换下变 149 常见的名字是left- / righthanded 旋量，但这个名字会引起 混乱，因为left-handed、righthanded 与螺旋性(helicity) 的 概念有关，螺旋性与手征性(chirality) 是不同的东西。尽管如此 这个名字还是反映了在宇称变换 下某个“左”的东西变成了“右” 的。\n\n为左手系那样，Lorentz 群的这两个表示也在宇称变换下来回变。\n\n旋转变换在两个表示之下相同，而推动变换差一个负号，上述 宇称变换的效果可总结为： 2 ,0) = e ⃗ϕ ⃗K → |{z} P e−⃗ϕ ⃗K = (Λ ⃗K)(0, 1 2 ) (3.224) (Λ ⃗K)( 1 2 ) = e−⃗ϕ ⃗K → |{z} P e ⃗ϕ ⃗K = (Λ ⃗K)( 1 2 ,0) (3.225) (Λ ⃗K)(0, 1 可见，描述一个在宇称变换下不变的物理体系同时需要左手旋量 和右手旋量。最简单的做法是把它们上下放置在一个对象中，该 对象称为Dirac 旋量：\n\n\u0013 = \u0012χa ξ ˙a\n\n\u0013 (3.226)\n\nΨ = \u0012χL ξR 前面提过左手、右手旋量统称Weyl 旋量，我们称一个Dirac 旋 量Ψ 包含两个Weyl 旋量χL 和ξR。注意Ψ 是一般形式，即χL 与ξR 之间并未钦点任何关系。而具有如下形式的Dirac 旋量\n\nΨM = \u0012χL χR\n\n\u0013 (3.227) 就是一个特例，称为Majorana 旋量。Dirac 旋量或Majorana 旋量 不是四维向量，它们的变换方式截然不同。Dirac 旋量按Lorentz 150( 1 2 , 0) ⊕(0, 1 2 ) 表示是一个可 约表示，这从它的变换矩阵是分 块对角矩阵可以看出。而四维向 量按( 1 群的(1 2, 0) ⊕(0, 1 2) 表示150变换，把左右旋量分别对应的变换矩阵 写成一个分块对角的大矩阵就是新的变换矩阵： 2 , 1 2 ) = ( 1 2 , 0) ⊗(0, 1 2 ) 表 示变换。\n\n! \u0012χL ξR\n\nΛ( 1\n\n\u0013 2 ,0) 0 0 Λ(0, 1\n\nΨ Lorentz 变换 −→ Ψ′ = Λ( 1 2 )Ψ = 2 ,0)⊕(0, 1 2 ) (3.228) 例如，Ψ 的推动变换为： e ⃗ϕ ⃗σ\n\n! \u0012χL ξR\n\n\u0013 (3.229) 2 0 0 e−⃗ϕ ⃗σ\n\nΨ 推动变换 −→ Ψ′ = 2 我们研究Dirac 旋量在宇称变换下的行为，是因为可以从它出发检 验某个理论在宇称变换下是否不变。我们知道宇称变换下N+ ↔ N−，因此Dirac 旋量经宇称变换后不再是Dirac 旋量（即那个根 2, 0) ⊕(0, 1 据Lorentz 群的(1 2) 表示变换的对象），再考虑到：\n\n\u0012 0, 1\n\n\u0013 ↔ |{z} P\n\n\u00121 2, 0 \u0013 (3.230) 2 3.7 Lorentz 群 67 2, 0) ⊕(0, 1 可以断定，因为Dirac 旋量按(1 2) 表示变换，故变换后 的对象按照(0, 1 2) ⊕(1 2, 0) 表示变换。\n\nΛ(0, 1\n\n! \u0012ξR χL\n\n\u0013 2 ) 0 0 Λ( 1\n\nΨP Lorentz 变换 −→ (ΨP )′ = Λ(0, 1 2 ,0)ΨP = 2 )⊕( 1 2 ,0) (3.231) 因此\n\n\u0013 (3.232)\n\n\u0013 宇称变换 −→ ΨP = \u0012ξR χL\n\nΨ = \u0012χL ξR 宇称变换将Dirac 旋量(包含ξR, χL) 变换为另一个同样具有\n\nξR, χL 的对象，只是上下位置变了。宇称变换的效果并非ξL →ξR， 具有这一效果的变换之后再讲述。\n\n3.7.10 Spinors and Charge Conjugation 旋量与电荷共轭 3.7.7节遇到了能使左手、右手旋量来回变换的变换（好绕）， χL →χC L = ϵχ∗ L = χR, ξR →ξC R = (−ϵ)ξ∗ R = ξL。此变换不属于 Lorentz 群，下面从另一角度来理解这一变换。\n\n到目前为止这个变换仅仅是升降旋量指标的技巧，现在考虑 Dirac 旋量在该变换下的表现，最简单的想可以写成：\n\n\u0013 = \u0012χR ξL\n\n\u0013 (3.233)\n\n\u0013 →˜Ψ = \u0012χC L ξC R\n\nΨ = \u0012χL ξR 151 与之前的宇称变换不同，这 里可以选择，我们更喜欢新对象 与原来的对象种类相同。˜Ψ 可以 视为经宇称变换和电荷共轭变换 后的Dirac 旋量。\n\n不幸的是新生儿˜Ψ 的变换方式与Dirac 旋量不同151，Dirac 旋量 在推动变换下的表现是： e ⃗θ ⃗σ\n\n! \u0012χL ξR\n\n\u0013 (3.234) 2 0 0 e−⃗θ ⃗σ\n\nΨ →Ψ′ = 2\n\n˜Ψ 按下式变换： e−⃗θ ⃗σ\n\n! \u0012χL ξR\n\n\u0013 (3.235) 2 0 0 e ⃗θ ⃗σ\n\n˜Ψ →˜Ψ′ = 2 它是一种新对象，因为它按照Lorentz 群的不同表示进行变换。通 过这些认识，我们可以令：\n\nΨ = \u0012χL ξR\n\n\u0013 →ΨC = \u0012ξC R χC L\n\n\u0013 = \u0012ξL χR\n\n\u0013 (3.236) 152 选读：注意Weyl 旋量实际 上是个二分量对象，稍后我们会 定义称为‘自旋’的可观测量，它 由1 2 σ3 描述。矩阵ϵ 可以将自 旋算符1 这样的变换就能满足Dirac 旋量的Lorentz 变换了。这个新变换 2 σ3 本征值+ 1 2 的本征 向量变换为本征值−1 通常称为荷共轭(charge conjugation) 变换，这个名字有点误 导性。由上式可知该变换将左手旋量变为右手旋量，也就是把描 2 对应的本 征向量。这称为自旋反转，即一 个自旋1 2 的对象变换为自旋−1 2 的对象。\n\n述基本粒子的一个标签翻转一下152。之后会看到该算符不止能翻 68 Chapter 3. Lie 群 转这一个标签，而是对基本粒子的所有标签都有效。其中一个标 签是电荷，因此该变换称为电荷共轭，在推导如何翻转电荷之前， 先要学习电荷到底是啥。有一点是很重要的：不止电荷能翻，别的 标签都可以。 我们可以接着推导Lorentz 群的更高维表示，但到现在为止 所有物理中常用的有限维不可约表示都已导出。物理上还要用到 无限维表示，用它来变换物理场。\n\n3.7.11 Infinite-Dimensional Representations 无限维表示 上面几节讨论了Lorentz 群的有限维表示及其分类，这些有 限维表示下的群元作用于1-, 2-或4-分量的对象。物理中经常处理 在时空中动力学演化的对象，下面考虑它们如何变换。前面处理 的Lorentz 变换可以写成如下形式：\n\nΦa →Φ′ a = Mab(Λ)Φb (3.237) 其中Mab(Λ) 是Lorentz 变换Λ 在某个有限维表示之下的矩阵形 式。例如Mab(Λ) 是个作用于Weyl 旋量的2 × 2 矩阵, 作用的结 果无非是新对象的分量为旧对象分量的线性组合。如果Φ 分布在 四维时空，即153Φ = Φ(x)，则Lorentz 变换（除了变换Φ 之外） 153x 是时空坐标t, x, y, z 的缩 写。\n\n还将变换时空坐标，一般情况下： xµ →Λµ νxν (3.238) 其中Λµ ν 是向量表示（即(1 2, 1 2) 表示）下的Lorentz 变换。场的 Lorentz 变换为154： 154 大部分文献采用对称操作 的Wigner 惯例形式：Φa(x) → Mab(Λ)Φb(Λ−1x)，但我们没有 什么理由在这里这么写。\n\nΦa(x) →Mab(Λ)Φb(Λx) (3.239) 155Φ 的每个分量都是坐标x 的 函数。相应的算符作用在Φa(x) 上，Φa(x) 是时空坐标的函数，而 在这种语境下的函数空间是无限 维的。 （原文为：‘The corresponding operators act on Φa(x) , i.e. functions of the coordinates and the space of functions is in this context infinitedimensional.’）函数空间之所以 是无限维是由于基函数的个数 是无穷多的。怎么把任意函数 用无穷个基函数展开会在附 录D.1 Fourier 展开中讲述。\n\n上式的变换包含两部分。一部分变换作用在Φa 上，对应于有限维 表示；而第二部分变换作用于坐标。第二部分作用于一个无限维 的155向量空间，因此需要用无限维表示。Lorentz 群的无限维表示 由如下微分算符156给出： Minf µν = i(xµ∂ν −xν∂µ) (3.240) 读者可自行验证Minf µν 满足Lorentz Lie 代数(3.167)式，并且可以 变换坐标。 这样坐标变换的形式为157,49：\n\nΦ(Λx) = e−i ωµν 2 Minf µν Φ(x) (3.241) 156 下式的符号∂ν 是偏导数符 号 ∂ ∂xν 的简写。\n\n其中e 指数函数定义为它的级数展开，前面已经讲过。完整的 157Mµν 在(3.165)式定义。分量 ωµν 与通常的转动角度θi 的关 系为θi = 1 Lorentz 变换是有限维表示Mfin µν 与无限维表示Minf µν 变换的组合： 2 ϵijkωjk，与推动参 数ϕi 的关系为ϕi = ω0i。\n\n49其中，下面的ωµν 是Lorentz 变换的参数。\n\n3.8 Poincaré 群 69\n\nΦa(x) Lorentz变换 −→ \u0012 e−i ωµν 2 Mfin µν \u0013b a e−i ωµν 2 Minf µν Φb(x) (3.242) 矩阵Mfin µν 是有限维的，它可以并入无限维矩阵中：\n\nΦa(x) Lorentz变换 −→ \u0012 e−i ωµν 2 Mµν \u0013b a Φb(x) (3.243) 其中Mµν = Mfin µν + Minf µν 。上式对应的Lorentz 群表示称为场表 示。\n\n现在可以讨论平移变换，即时空中某点的对象变换到另一点的 变换。平移变换的结果并非各分量的组合，因此不需要有限维表示 描述平移，而很容易地找到相应的无限维表示。这不再是Lorentz 群的部分，但是自然定律应该在时空各点都相同。Lorentz 群（推 动+ 转动）加上平移变换称为Poincaré 群，下一节具体讲述。这 里首先引入平移的无限维表示。简明起见，考虑一维情形，一个函 数沿x 轴的无穷小平移变换为：\n\nΦ(x) →Φ(x + ϵ) = Φ(x) + ∂xΦ(x) | {z } 沿x 轴的‘变化率’\n\nϵ 上式就是Taylor 级数展开的前两项。按照惯例，相应的生成元额 外乘以−i： Pi ≡−i∂i (3.244) 这样，任意的有限大小的平移变换为：\n\nΦ(x) →Φ(x + a) = e−iaiPiΦ(x) = eai∂iΦ(x) 其中ai 表示沿各个方向的平移数量。把e 指数函数展开为Taylor 158 这在附录B.4.1 中推导。\n\n级数158就能看出上式就是Φ(x + a) 的Taylor 展开159。平移到另 一个时间点使用P0 = i∂0，平移到另一空间点使用Pi = −i∂i。\n\n159 这在附录B.3 中推导。\n\n3.8 The Poincaré group Poincaré 群 现在考虑自然界完整的时空对称群：Poincaré 群。Lorentz 群 包含转动和推动变换，而保证光速不变的还有时空中的平移变换， 因为在不同时空点测量的光速是相同的。等价地说，光速与所用 坐标系原点的位置无关。将这一对称性加入Lorentz 群之后就得 160Poincaré 群并非Lorentz 群 与平移变换的直和(direct sum)， 而是半直和(semi-direct sum)， 但现在可以忽略此数学细节。\n\n到Poincaré 群160： Poincaré 群= Lorentz 群+ 平移\n\n= 旋转+ 推动+ 平移 (3.245) 70 Chapter 3. Lie 群 Poincaré 群的生成元是Lorentz 群的生成元Ji, Ki 加上平移变换 的在Minkowski 空间的生成元Pµ。 用Ji, Ki, Pµ 表示的Lie 代数为161： [Ji, Jj] = iϵijkJk (3.246) [Ji, Kj] = iϵijkKk (3.247) [Ki, Kj] = −iϵijkJk (3.248) [Ji, Pj] = iϵijkPk (3.249) [Ji, P0] = 0 (3.250) [Ki, Pj] = iδijP0 (3.251) [Ki, P0] = −iPi (3.252) 上面的形式比较凌乱，定义Mµν 来表述会整洁的多，Mµν 的定义 为： Ji = 1 2ϵijkMjk (3.253) Ki = M0i (3.254) 用Mµν 表示的Poincaré Lie 代数为： [Pµ, Pν] = 0 (3.255) [Mµν, Pρ] = i(ηµρPν −ηνρPµ) (3.256) 由定义式可得 [Mµν, Mρσ] = i(ηµρMνσ −ηµσMνρ −ηνρMµσ +ηνσMµρ) (3.257) Poincaré 群是相当复杂的，有必要将它的表示用Casimir 算 符固有的标量值加以标记。Poincaré 群有两个Casimir 算符162，第 一个是： 162 复习：Casimir 算符是从生 成元构造的、与所有生成元都对 易的算符。\n\nPµP µ =: m2 (3.258) 这个标量值记作m2，它的含义你懂的。稍后我们就看到它就是粒 子质量163。 第二个Casimir 算符为WµW µ，其中164： W µ = 1 163 别担心，后面会详谈。\n\n2ϵµνρσPνMρσ (3.259) 164ϵµνρσ 是四维Levi-Civita 符 号，在附录B.5.5中定义。\n\nW µ 称为Pauli-Lubanski 四维向量。经过超级繁琐的计算之后 可以证明。相应的标量值记作j ≡j1 + j2，它通常称为自旋。现在 “自旋”只是个名字，稍后会看到它有什么含义。对于Lorentz 群， 165 复习：Lorentz 群的Lie 代 数可以视为两份SU(2)Lie 代数 SU(2) 群的表示可以用一个数j 标记，于是Lorentz 群双覆盖的 表示可以用两个数(j1, j2) 标记。\n\n它的两个165SU(2) Lie 代数每个都对应一个ji。\n\n例如，(j1, j2) = (0, 0) 表示称为自旋0 表示166，(j1, j2) = ( 1 2, 0) 与(j1, j2) = (0, 1 2) 都称为自旋1 2 表示167，然后(j1, j2) = ( 1 2, 1 2) 表示称为自旋1 表示168。 综上，Poincaré 群的表示用两个标量来标记：m, j。其中m 166j1 + j2 = 0 + 0 = 0. 167j1+j2 = 1 2 +0 = 0+ 1 2 = 1 2 . 可以取任意值，j 只能取整数或半整数。\n\n3.9 基本粒子 71 3.9 Elementary Particles 基本粒子 Poincaré 群不可约表示的标记就是物理学对基本粒子的标 169 其他说法：基本粒子是 Poincaré 群的不可约表示。\n\n记169：质量m 与自旋（这里就是j）。对给定质量m 与自旋 （例如j = 1 2）的基本粒子的描述，需要按Poincaré 群的m, 自旋 1 2 表示变换。\n\n粒子的更多特征量（例如电荷）将从内禀对称性导出，这些标 签用来定义一种基本粒子。例如，电子的定义为：\n\n• 质量：9.109 × 10−31kg • 自旋：1 2 • 电子电荷：1.602 × 10−19C • 弱荷，称为弱同位旋：−1 2 • 强荷，称为色荷：0 这些标签决定了一种基本粒子在实验中的观测值。本章导出的各 种表示使我们能在数学上描述它们。基本粒子可分为如下几种170： 170 第一章导论介绍不能推导的 内容说过，没有理由只有三个表 示对应基本粒子。我们可以继续 考虑更高维的表示，但没发现对 应的粒子，比如自旋3\n\n• 自旋0，由标量（记作Φ）描述，标量按Poincaré 群的(0, 0) 表示（称为自旋0 表示或标量表示）变换。例如Higgs 粒子 由一个标量场描述。\n\n2 的粒子。 然而这些表示可以描述复合对 象。此外，许多物理学家认为传 递引力作用的基本粒子——引力 子的自旋为2，因此必须用相应 的高维表示来描述它。\n\n• 自旋1 2，由旋量（记作Ψ）描述。旋量按(1 2, 0) ⊕(0, 1 2) 表示 （称为自旋1 2 表示或旋量表示）变换。例如电子和夸克由旋 量描述。\n\n• 自旋1，由向量（记作A）描述。向量按照(1 2, 1 2) 表示（称 为自旋1 表示或向量表示）变换。例如光子由向量描述。\n\n上面的结论是物理学重要、深刻而优美的创见，因此再重复一 遍： Poincaré 群的不可约表示是描述所有基本粒子的数学工具。\n\n描述标量粒子（例如Higgs Boson）的数学对象称为标量，它根据 自旋0 表示变换。描述自旋1 2 粒子（例如电子、中微子、夸克等 等）的数学对象称为旋量，它根据自旋1 2 表示变换。描述光子或 其它自旋1 的粒子所用的对象称为向量，它根据自旋1 表示变换。\n\n关于自旋这个充满暗示的名字的详细解释在讨论完实验观测 之后的8.5.5节讲述。想要弄清楚自旋的含义，我们必须要知道如 何通过实验观测研究对象是否在“自旋”。现在把自旋仅仅当做一 个名词就好。\n\n171 John Stillwell.

Lie 群 3.10 Appendix: Rotations in a Complex Vector Space 附录： 复向量空间中的旋转 在复向量空间也可定义保证内积不变的变换。我们希望一个 向量与其自身的内积为实数，这样才能让它等于向量的模的平方， 模长为复数没有物理意义。因此复向量内积的定义（除了转置以 173z = a+ib, z∗= a−ib，因此 z∗z = (a + ib)(a −ib) = a2 + b2 ∈R. 外还）附加了取复共轭的操作173： a · a = (aT )∗a = a†a (3.260) 符号† 称为dagger，表示厄米共轭操作，即取复共轭+ 转置。保 证内积不变的变换U 必须满足U†U = 1： (Ua)† · (Ua) = a†U†Ua = a†a (3.261) 这种形式的变换记作U(n)，其中n 表示复向量空间的维数，“U” 表示幺正性。复习一下，SU(n) 群称为特殊(special) 幺正群，因 为它的群元还满足det(U) = 1。\n\n3.11 Appendix: Manifolds 附录：流形 流形M 是满足如下条件的点的集合：对于M 的任意开邻 域，存在将开邻域映射到Rn 开子集的一一映射。简单地说，该定 义意味着流形M 局部地与Rn 类似。M 的开邻域到Rn 的映射 将M 中的点P 对应到一个n 元数组 \u0000 x1(P), . . . , xn(P) \u0001 ，其中 x1(P), . . . , xn(P) 称为P 点的坐标。因此n 维流形可以看做这样 的点集：任意点的邻域都可对应n 个独立坐标。\n\n流形的典型例子是球面，三维球体的表面称为2-球面(twosphere)，记作S2，定义为R3 当中满足x2 + y2 + z2 = r2 的点的 集合，其中r 为球半径。注意三维球体的表面是二维的，因为它的 定义有三个坐标与一个约束条件，这样减少了一个自由度。这也 是数学上称之为2-球面的原因。为了表明球面是个流形，我们需 要找出从球面到R2 的映射，这个映射可以由通常的球坐标给出。\n\n3.11 附录：流形 73 图3.8: 从球面的一个邻域到R2 映射的图示 球面上几乎所有的点都可明确地对应于坐标(φ, θ)，几乎所有\n\n⋯⋯但是极点φ = 0 映射到哪儿？不可能有一对一的点，因为极 点对应的是一整条线，在上图已经画出。因此球坐标映射不能覆盖 整个球面，还需要一个映射将极点及其邻域映射到R2。相似的问 题还出现在θ = 0 对应的半圆处，θ = 0 与θ = 2π 映射到R2 的 同一个点，因此也不是一一映射。这说明对流形而言，一般不存在 一个覆盖流形所有点的全局坐标系，而只有局域坐标系，即仅覆盖 某一邻域的坐标系。不过这没关系，因为流形的特征是局部像Rn。\n\n上面说到，球坐标系映射只对开邻域0 < φ < π, 0 < θ < 2π 有效，还需要另外的映射来覆盖整个球面。可以使用第二个球坐 标系——坐标轴的指向不同，使得有问题的极点不再对应φ = 0， 在第二个映射补充下，球面上所有的点都可映射到R2，于是2-球 面确实是个流形。\n\n流形的平凡例子是Rn，根据定义容易看出。\n\n4. The Framework 理论框架 这一章的基本思路是，我们要通过使某些东西取极小值，得到 正确的关于自然的方程。某些东西是什么？至少我们知道一件事： 它不应该在Lorentz 变换下改变，否则我们会在不同的参考系下 得到不同的自然规律。在数学意义上，它意味着我们寻找的这个 东西是个标量，依照Lorentz 群的(0, 0) 表示作变换。再加上到自 然对简单规律的偏好，导出关于自然的方程绰绰有余。\n\n从这个想法出发，我们将会引入拉格朗日形式(Lagrangian formalism)。通过使理论的中心对象取极小值，可以得到用以描述 问题中的物理系统的运动方程。极小化过程的结果被称作欧拉-拉 格朗日方程(Euler-Lagrange equations)。\n\n通过拉格朗日形式，可以得到物理中最重要的定理之一：Noether 定理(Noether’s Theorem)。这个定理揭示了对称性和守恒 1 守恒量指的是不随时间变化 的物理量。例如一个给定体系 的能量或动量。数学上意味着 dQ/dt = 0 →Q = 常数。\n\n量1之间的深刻联系。我们将在下一章中利用它来理解, 理论是如 何来描述实验测量量的。\n\n2 物理中当然有其他框架， 例如以哈密顿量 (Hamiltonian) 为中心对象的哈密顿 形式(Hamiltonian formalism)。哈密顿量的问题在于它 不是洛伦兹不变的，因为它所代 表的能量，仅仅是协变能动矢量 (covariant energy-impulse vector) 的一个分量 4.1 Lagrangian Formalism 拉格朗日形式 拉格朗日形式是在基础物理中被广泛运用的一个强有力的框 架2。由于理论的基本对象——拉格朗日量(Lagrangian) 是一个 标量3，它相对简单。如果你希望从对称性的观点考虑问题，这种形 式将会是非常有用的。要求拉格朗日量的积分，作用量(action)， 3 标量指依照洛伦兹群的(0, 0) 表示作变换的对象。这意味着它 不在洛伦兹变换下改变 在某些对称变换下不变，即保证了体系的动力学遵从该对称性。\n\n76 Chapter 4. 理论框架 4.1.1 Fermat 原理 自然界中不论发生什么过程，由此造成作用量的改变 总尽可能的小。\n\n4Recherche des loix du mouvement (1746)\n\n- Pierre de Maupertius 4 拉格朗日形式的思想源于Fermat 原理：光在两空间点间传播 总依耗时最短的路径q(t) 而行。数学上来讲，如果我们定义给定 路径q(t) 的作用量为 Slight[q(t)] = Z dt 5 此处的作用量仅仅是沿给定路 径对时间的积分，但一般而言作 用量会更加复杂，我们待会儿就 能见到 而我们的任务便是找到一条特定的路径q(t) 使作用量取极小值5为 了得到一个给定函数的极小值6，我们可以求得其导函数并令其为 零；而为了找到泛函S[q(t)]1——函数q(t) 的函数S——的极小 6 一般而言，我们希望找到极值 (extremums)，即极小值和极 大值。下一节中的方法足以找到 这两者。无论如何，我们将继续 谈论极小值 值，就得要一个新的数学工具：变分法。\n\n4.1.2 变分法：基本思想 在思考如何发展一套能够找到泛函极值的新理论之前，我们 需要倒回去想想什么给出一个数学上的极小点。变分法给出的答 案是，极小点由极小点邻域的性质决定。例如，让我们尝试寻找 一个寻常函数f(x) = 3x2 + x 的极小点xmin。我们从一个特定点 x = a 出发，仔细考察其邻域。数学上它意味着a + ϵ，其中ϵ 代 表无穷小量（可正可负）。我们将a 的变分代入函数f(x): 图4.1: 对于给定初末端 f(a + ϵ) = 3(a + ϵ)2 + (a + ϵ) = 3(a2 + 2aϵ + ϵ2) + a + ϵ。\n\n点的路径的扰动 如果a 是极小点，ϵ 的一阶变分必须为零，否则我们可以取ϵ 为负\n\nϵ < 0，这样f(a + ϵ) 就会比f(a) 更小2。因此，我们将线性依赖 于ϵ 的项取出并令其为零。\n\n3 · 2aϵ + ϵ != 0 →6a + 1 != 0。\n\n由此我们找到极小点 xmin = a = −1 6， 它自然和我们求导f(x) = 3x2 + x →f′(x) = 6x + 1 并令其为零 的办法得到的结果一致。对于寻常函数而言，这只是一个用来干 1译者注：这里的q(t) 原文一会儿用粗体，一会不用，不知道想表达什么，此 处与原文保持一致。\n\n2译注：此处讨论有误。可改作“否则若ϵ 的一阶变分为正，我们可以…，反 之亦然。”\n\n4.2 限制 77 同一件事不同方法而已3，但是变分法却能找到泛函的极值点。我 们马上就能看到，应当如何处理一个一般的作用量泛函。\n\n拉格朗日形式的中心思想在于，对于有质量的物体也存在一 个与光的Fermat 原理相类似的原理。当然，它不可能直接遵从费 马原理，但是我们可以从一个更一般的形式出发 S[q(t)] = Z L dt 其中L 一般是一个非常数的参量，称为拉格朗日量。对于光而言， 这个参量是个常数。一般的，拉格朗日量依赖于物体的坐标和速度 L = L(q(t), ∂ 7 我们的任务是找到对于给定拉 格朗日量和初始条件有着最小作 用量的路径q(t)。在此之前，我 们得先找到正确的拉格朗日量， 用以描述问题中的物理系统。这 是我们在上一章中所讨论的对称 性所能发挥作用的地方。通过要 求拉格朗日量在洛伦兹群的所有 变换下不变，我们就能找到正确 的拉格朗日量\n\n∂tq(t))。下一节中我们将仔细讨论这件事7。在仔细讨 论如何对这样一个泛函使用变分法之前，我们需要先讲讲两个小 问题。\n\n4.2 Restrictions 限制 正如1.1节所提到的，现有理论中有些限制条件无法从第一性 原理中得到。我们所能知道是，如果想得到一个有意义的理论，我 们必须加上这些限制。\n\n一个重要的限制是，我们仅允许拉格朗日量中出现尽可能低 阶的非平凡4导数。这里平凡指的是对于系统的动力学，即运动 方程，没有影响。某些理论会包含一阶导数，另外一些带二阶导 数。一个给定理论所含的最低阶导数由该条件决定：拉格朗日量 8 实际上，作用量才应该是 Lorentz 不变的。但如果拉格朗 日量满足这个条件，那作用量自 然也是。\n\n在Lorentz 变换下不变8，否则我们将在不同的参考系下导出不同 的运动方程5。对于某些理论，我们无法写出一个仅含一阶导数项 的不变量，那么此时二阶导数便成了最低阶导数项。\n\n9 这些困难称为Ostrogradski 不 稳定性，即包含高阶导数的系统 的能量没有下界，以至于系统中 的所有态总会自发衰变到能量更 低的态上去。这类系统中找不到 稳定的状态。\n\n我们并不清楚如何处理包含高阶导数的理论，它们有一些深 刻的、系统性的困难9。另外，拉格朗日量中的高阶导数会使得运 动方程中也包含高阶导数，这样就必须知道更多的初始条件才能 决定物体的运动。\n\n10 局域性是狭义相对论的基本 假定，2.4节已作阐述 有些人会宣称对理论所包含导数阶数的限制源于我们希望得 到一个局域10理论，但这个要求仅会排除掉那些无穷阶导数。一个 11 我们将会讨论粒子的拉格朗 日理论：寻求粒子的路径；也会 讨论场的拉格朗日理论：寻求场 函数Φ(x)。这将是下一节的主 题。\n\n非局域相互作用有如下形式11\n\nΦ(x −h)Φ(x) (4.1) 即，时空中距离为h 的两个点的场相互作用。利用Taylor 展开我 3译注：对于受微元法茶毒的物竞生而言，求导才是用来干这件事的不同方法。\n\n4译注：原文为‘non-trival’. Trival 这个词常包含简单、弱智、无意义之义。\n\n5译注：此处讨论疑有误，作者此前并没有说明积分中的时间是坐标时还是固 有时 78 Chapter 4. 理论框架 们有6\n\n\u0012 ∂\n\n! (−h)k\n\n\u0013k Φ(x)|x\n\n∞ X k! (4.2)\n\nΦ(x −h) =\n\n∂x k=0 即包含无穷阶导数会导致一个非局域的理论。\n\n另外一个限制是，要得到一个自由（无相互作用）场/粒子的 理论，我们只能写到二次项。这意味着我们只会考虑12 12 从另外一个角度来看，这再次 表示我们只引入最低阶的非平凡 项。我们随后就会看到，含Φ0\n\nΦ0, Φ1, Φ2 和Φ1 的项是平凡的，因此我们 这次用的是Φ 的最低阶非平凡 项 这样的项。例如，形如Φ2∂µΦ 的项是Φ 的三阶项，因而不会被包 含在我们自由理论的拉格朗日量中。\n\n4.3 Particle Theories vs. Field Theories 粒子理论与场论 我们目前有两套用以描述自然的理论框架。一套是粒子理论， 用依赖于时间的粒子位置描述物理系统，即⃗q = ⃗q(t)。由于我们不 13 例如，我们可以用球坐标系 是非得在使用笛卡尔坐标系13，所以用的是字母q 而不是x。对于 这样的理论，拉格朗日量依赖于坐标⃗q，速度∂t⃗q 和时间t：7 L = L(⃗q, ∂t⃗q, t) (4.3) 一个著名的拉格朗日量是L = 1 2m⃗q2，它能导出经典力学中的 14 量子场论有一个特别优美的 性质是关于如何引进粒子的。我 们将在第6章中看到场有能力产 生和湮灭粒子 Newton 运动方程。在稍后将进行相当详细的讨论。\n\n另一套是场论：使用场而不是独立粒子的坐标来描述自然14。\n\n在这套理论中，时空构成了场Φ(⃗x, t) 表演的舞台。利用前面提到 过的限制，我们得到15 15 这里我故意使用了不同的符 号L ，因为在场论中大多数时 候我们都在和拉格朗日量密度 L 打交道。两者之间满足关系 式L = R d3x L L = L (Φ(⃗x, t), ∂µΦ(⃗x, t), ⃗x) (4.4) 2 \u0000 ∂µΦ∂µΦ −m2Φ2\u0001 ， 这里一个著名的拉格朗日量密度L = 1 它可以导出Klein-Gordon 方程。\n\n场论的一大优点是它将时空等价的对待。在粒子理论中我们 使用空间坐标⃗q(t) 作为时间的函数来描述粒子。尤其是，拉格朗 日量中没有类似于∂⃗qt 的项（如果出现了这类项，我们该怎样理解 它呢？）当我们讨论粒子的坐标时，意义是清楚的，但对时间做类 似的陈述时，却很难有明确的意义8。\n\n6译注：此式有误，已更正 7译注：严格说来，依赖于坐标函数⃗q(t)，速度函数∂t⃗q(t) 和时间t 8译注：利用不那么古老的相对论性语言，粒子理论下时空坐标是可以在形式 上被同等对待的：用以求导的东西只能是曲线的参数，它可以取作粒子世界线的 固有时、某一坐标系的坐标时、或者其他什么东西（只要性质合适，也可以是空 间坐标）；而时空坐标则被同样的求导。\n\n4.4 欧拉-拉格朗日方程 79 讨论了这么多，我们终于可以回到这章开头所说的极小化问 题上来了。我们希望找到某些泛函 S[q(t)] = Z L dt 的极小值，以得到正确的运动方程。\n\n对于粒子而言，方程的解是使得泛函取极小值的正确路径；而 对于场而言，解是正确的场函数。\n\n此刻请不用担心L 的具体形式，下面数章将详细讨论如何对 问题中的系统导出正确的拉格朗日量L。现在，我们将使用之前所 介绍过的变分法，对于一个一般的L 导出泛函S[q(t)] 的极小值。\n\n极小化过程将给出系统的运动方程。\n\n4.4 Euler-Lagrange equation 欧拉-拉格朗日方程 我们从粒子理论出发，它能让我们搞清楚，在给定初末端点 后，粒子是如何在两点间运动的。数学上，即寻找函数q(t) 使得作 用量9 t1 L \u0012 q(t), dq(t) dt , t \u0013 S = Z t2 取极值（极大值或极小值）。\n\n使用记号\n\n˙q(t) = dq(t) dt 。\n\n与之前的例子类似，取q(t) = a(t) 并让对这个函数进行一个扰动 a(t) + ϵ(t) 其中ϵ 依旧是一个无穷小量。对于一个粒子而言，我们必须同时 改变其速度˙a(t) + ˙ϵ(t)，其中˙ϵ(t) = dϵ(t) dt 。\n\n在边界上，扰动后的路径应与原路径相同： 0 = ϵ(t1) = ϵ(t2) (4.5) 这是因为我们寻找的是使作用量积分取极值的给定初末端点的路 径。\n\n这个扰动使得泛函变为 S = Z t2 t1 L (q + ϵ, ˙q + ˙ϵ, t) dt。\n\n16 我们使用的是这个公式的多 变量形式，参见附录B.3： 与之前的例子类似，极小值要求线性依赖于扰动ϵ 的项为零。由 L (q + ϵ, ˙q + ˙ϵ, t) = L(q, ˙q, t)+ 于我们处理的是一般的L，故将其展开成Taylor 级数16，并令一\n\n∂q + ˙ϵ∂L\n\nϵ∂L\n\n∂˙q + . . . 9译注：此处L 原文字体有误，已更正 80

数，乘以变量自身的改变，之 和。例如，三维空间中的函数 f(x(t), y(t), z(t)) 的总变化率为 df\n\n\u0012∂L(q, ˙q, t)\n\n\u0013 = 0 (4.7)\n\n∂q −d\n\n∂L dt\n\n∂˙q 这就是著名的欧拉-拉格朗日方程(Euler-Lagrange equation) dt = ∂f\n\n∂t + ∂f\n\n∂y ∂y\n\n∂t + ∂f\n\n∂z ∂z ∂t 。即 变化率乘以自身的改变量。相对 的，偏导数仅给出总改变量的一 部分。对于一个不显式的依赖于 t 的函数，其偏导数为零。例如， 对于f(x(t), y(t)) = x2y + y3， 我们有 ∂f\n\n∂x ∂x 我们可以用类似的办法处理场论。首先，注意到场论将时空同 等对待。因此引入拉格朗日量密度： L = Z d3x L (Φi, ∂µΦi) (4.8)\n\n∂t = 0，但 ∂f ∂x = 2xy ̸= 0, ∂f\n\n∂y = x2 + 3y2 ̸= 并用拉格朗日量密度来表示作用量\n\n∂t + (x2 + 3y2) ∂y 0。因此df dt = 2xy ∂x S = Z dt L = Z d4x L (Φi, ∂µΦi) (4.9)\n\n∂t 。作为对比，对于另一个 函数g(x(t), y(t), t) = x2t + y 我们有∂g\n\n∂t = x2 19 在这里用“组”字是因为对于 每一个场分量Φ1, Φ2, . . . 我们 都可以得到一个方程 依照上面讲过的步骤，我们可以得到场的运动方程组10 19：\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µΦi)\n\n\u0013 = 0 (4.10)\n\n∂L ∂Φi −∂µ 20 我们将其视做锚定这个复杂 的世界之物。不论万事万物如何 改变，守恒量依旧是守恒量。\n\n下一节中将在拉格朗日形式下导出近代物理学中重要的一个 定理。从中可以看到对称性与守恒量之间的深刻联系。守恒量是 描述自然的合适参量20，这个定理将教会我们如何和它打交道。\n\n10不对i 求和 4.5 Noether 定理 81 4.5 Noether’s Theorem Noether 定理 Noether 定理表示，拉格朗日量的每一个对称性都直接对应一 个守恒量。换言之，物理学家用于描述自然（守恒量）的记号和对 称性直接相关。这确实是科学史上最美的创见之一。\n\n4.5.1 粒子理论的Noether 定理 先看看能对粒子理论中的守恒量做点什么。我们限于讨论连续 对称性，这样才能使用无穷小变换。如同上一章所言，重复进行无 21 用符号δ 来表述小扰动，希 望不会和用来表述偏导数的∂相 混淆。\n\n穷小变换可以得到一个有限变换。拉格朗日量在无穷小变换21q → q′ = q + δq 下不变的性质用数学表述如下11\n\nδL = L(q, dq dt , t) −L(q + δq, d(q + δq) dt , t) dt , t) != 0 (4.11)\n\n= L(q, dq dt , t) −L(q + δq, dq dt + dδq 要求拉格朗日量是变换不变的，这个限制太强了。为了保证动 力学性质一样，要求不变的应该是作用量而不是拉格朗日量。当 然，如果拉格朗日量不变，作用量自然不变：\n\nδS = Z dt L(q, dq dt , t) − Z dt L(q + δq, dq dt , t) = Z dt δL = |{z} 若δL=0 0 (4.12) 在什么情况下，拉格朗日量改变而作用量不变呢？答案是，给拉格 朗日量加上一个任意函数G 对时间的全导数 L →L + dG dt 这时作用量不变22 22 用到了δG = ∂G\n\n∂q δq\n\nδS →δS′ = δS + Z t2\n\n∂q δq。这是因 为G = G(q) 而我们改变了q， 故G 的扰动等于改变率∂G t2 t1 dt d dtδG = δS + ∂G\n\n.\n\n∂q 乘 上q 的扰动 t1 | {z } =0 因为δq(t1)=δq(t2)=0 最后一步中用到了扰动δq 在初末时刻12t1, t2 为零。由此可知，拉 格朗日量的扰动δL 不必非要为零，而仅需满足一个更弱的条件\n\nδL != dG dt 。 (4.13) 这意味着拉格朗日量可以在不改变作用量和运动方程的情况 dt 。将(4.11)式的右端由0 改作dG 下，加减某个函数的全微分dG dt ， 我们有\n\nδL = L(q, dq

由此得到了一个不随时间变化的物理量J： J = ∂L\n\n∂˙q δq + G， (4.17) 这是因为 dJ dt = 0 →J = 常数。\n\n为了看清楚这一点，先借用一下后面章节的结论：常质量自由 粒子的Newton 第二定律是25 25 如果q 代表某个物体的位置， 则 dq dt = ˙q 是这个物体的速度， m¨⃗q = 0。 (4.18) d dt dq dt = d2q 相应的拉格朗日量是26 dt2 = ¨q 是加速度。\n\nL = 1 2m˙⃗q2 (4.19) 26 我们现在处理的是高于一维 的问题，所以使用矢量⃗q 和⃗a 而 不是q 和a。\n\n你可以将其代入欧拉-拉格朗日方程（(4.7)式）中去验证它。 让我们从这个拉格朗日量出发，计算不同对称性所分别对应 的守恒量。 由于L = 1 2m˙⃗q 2 不依赖于⃗q，故此拉格朗日量在空间平移变 换⃗q

了动量守恒。\n\n13译注：使用了求和约定，见第3章边注129 4.5 Noether 定理 83 现在考虑旋转变换，这得需要大于一的维度，因为一维上的旋 转是没有意义的。下面将不会使用类似⃗q 的矢量符号，而是更方 便的指标记号。我们能将所有方程简单的用⃗q →qi 改写。考虑无 穷小旋转27qi →qi + ϵijkqjak，由此δqi = ϵijkqjak。仍然是因为由 于L = 1 27

式出现在形形色色的物理理论中。只要我们依旧有通常的时空对 称性，动量、能量和角动量就是守恒量。在场论中，有两类对称 性：一方面，拉格朗日量会在时空变换（如旋转）下不变；另一 方面，我们也会有在场自身的变换下的不变性，称为内禀对称性 (internal symmetries)。\n\n4.5.2 场论中的Noether 定理——时空对称性 对于场，我们得区分在时空变换下两类不同的改变。当观测 者S 看到场Ψ(x) 时，观测者S′ 看到的则是场Ψ′(x′)。这是同一 个场，只是从不同的视角来看，会有不同的分量值。这两类描述 之间由Lorentz 群中的一个合适的变换相联系。我们现在将会使 用在3.7.11节中介绍过的场表示。（无穷维）微分算符表示x 变换 到x′。这意味着利用这个表示我们能在不同的时空点或者在一个 32 请回忆这个例子，Weyl 旋量 有两个分量而矢量场有四个分

Measuring Nature 测量 现在已经发现对称性与守恒量之间的关系了，接下来就可以 利用这种联系。用更专业的话说，Noether 定理建立了对称变换的 生成元与相应守恒量之间的联系。本章将利用这种联系。\n\n守恒量常常被物理学家们用来描述物理系统，因为无论这个 系统经历了怎样复杂的变化，守恒量都是一样的。比如，物理学家 们为了描述一个实验会使用动量，能量或角动量。Noether 定理提 示了一个至关重要的思想：描述自然的物理量等同于其对应的生 成元： 物理量⇒对应对称性的生成元 (5.1) 我们会看到这种选择会自然地导出量子理论。下面通过考虑 粒子理论来实现。\n\n5.1 Operators of Quantum Mechanics 量子力学中的算符 惯例用一个尖帽子ˆO 来表示一个算符 拉格朗日量在空间平移变换的生成元的作用下不变可导出动 量守恒。因此，由此可得1 动量ˆpi →空间平移操作的生成元：−i∂i 1译者注：这里再次提醒一下，本书中虚数单位与指标经常共用字母i，相信 聪明的读者有能力分辨。\n\n96 Chapter 5. 测量 类似的，时间平移生成元带来的不变性给出能量守恒，也就是 能量ˆE →时间平移操作的生成元−i∂0 没有关于“位置守恒” 的对称性，所以位置并没有伴随生成元， 我们有1 1 或者说，我们可以观察守恒量 与对应的推动下的不变性。注意 到我们在4.6节中得到的非相对 论性Galilei 推动下的守恒量是 从非相对论性的拉格朗日量得出 来的。同样，我们可以对相对论性 拉格朗日量做一样的事情，得到 守恒量t⃗p−⃗xE。相对论性能量由 E = p 位置ˆxi →xi 上面利用算符给出了描述自然的理论中使用的物理量。接下 来我们自然要问：这些算符作用在什么上面？它们是如何与实验 中的可观测量联系起来的呢？下一章仔细讨论这件事情，在这里 只需要知道物理量，也就是算符，是作用在某物上的。不妨就认为 它作用于一个抽象的对象上，称之为Ψ，后面会探究这个“某物” m2 + p2 给出。在相对论 性极限c →∞下，我们有E ≈ m，并且，Lorentz 推动下的守恒 量回到我们的Galilei 推动的结 果。因此，粒子理论的守恒量为 Mi = (tpi−xiE)。推动的生成元 （见(3.240)，其中Ki = M0i）为 Ki = i(x0∂i −xi∂0)。比较两者， 其中x0 = t，给出Mi = (tpi − xiE) ↔Ki = i(t∂i −xi∂0)。因 此，利用我们之前的选择，很直 观的我们有，坐标：ˆxi →xi 2 如果你完全不了解量子力学， 为什么这些简单的式子会如此重 要对你来说会看起来比较奇怪。 你也许听说过Heisenberg 不确 定性原理。在第8.3节，我们会更 进一步的研究量子力学的形式与 结构，然后就可以看到这个方程 表明不能够以任意精度同时测量 一个粒子的动量和坐标。我们的 物理量的解释是算符的测量，而 这个方程告诉我们先测量动量再 测量位置与先测量位置再测量动 量是完全不一样的。\n\n是什么鬼。 现在可以导出一些非常重要的2量子力学的方程了。就像上面 已经解释过的那样，我们假定算符作用在抽象的Ψ 上。于是有 [ˆpi, ˆxj]Ψ = (ˆpiˆxj −ˆxj ˆpi)Ψ = i(−∂iˆxj + ˆxj∂i)Ψ\n\n= |{z} 莱布尼兹律 −i(∂iˆxj)Ψ −\u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018 iˆxj(∂iΨ) +\u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018 iˆxj(∂iΨ) = |{z}\n\n−iδijΨ\n\n∂iˆxj= ∂xj ∂xi (5.2) 这个方程对任意的Ψ 都成立，因为我们没有对Ψ 做任何假 设，因此我们可以不考虑它3而直接的写出 [ˆpi, ˆxj] = −iδij (5.3) 5.1.1 Spin and Angular Momentum 自旋与角动量 上一章的第4.5.4节中讲过，对标量理论而言，旋转不变性带 来的守恒量有两个部分，第二部分对应轨道角动量，称之为无限 维的轨道角动量生成元表示。\n\n3 如果你以前没有过这个观念， 注意我们可以把每一个矢量方程 都写成只包含数的形式。比如，牛 顿第二定律⃗F = m⃗¨x，可以对于 任意矢量⃗C 写出⃗F ⃗C = m⃗¨x ⃗C。 不仅如此，如果对于任意的⃗C 都 成立，那么一直把这个⃗C 写着也 就没什么意义了。\n\n轨道角动量ˆLi →转动生成元（无限维表示）i1 2ϵijk(xj∂k−xk∂j) 类似的，第一部分称作自旋，对应有限维度的生成元4的表示。\n\n自旋ˆSi →转动生成元（有限维表示）Si 如前面(4.30)式解释过的那样，Sµν 和转动算符生成元Si 的关系 为Si = 1 4 这是从场的分量的线性组合下 的不变性带来的守恒量，因此是 有限维的表示。\n\n2ϵijkSjk。\n\n比如，当我们考虑自旋1 2 场的时候，我们需要用到我们在3.7.5节 中得到的二维表示：\n\nˆSi = iσi 2 (5.4) 其中σi 是Pauli 矩阵。在学习如何利用本章导出的这些算符之后， 我们在8.5.5节深入讨论这一有趣而奇怪的类型的角动量。时刻注 意，只有这两部分角动量的和是守恒的。\n\n5.2 量子场论的算符 97 5.2 The Operators of Quantum Field Theory 量子场论的算符 5 这里，x = x0, x1, x2, x3，包 含时间x0 = t。\n\n场论的最重要的客体当然就是作为时空位置的函数5的场了\n\nΦ = Φ(x)。我们接下来希望描述时空上的一个点发生的相互作用， 从而我们需要考虑动力学变量π = π(x) 的密度，而不是其其总量 Π = R d3xπ(x) ̸= Π(x)。\n\n我们上一章发现了场自身的平移不变性Φ →Φ −iϵ 产生了一 种新的守恒量，称为共轭动量Π。就像我们上一章做的那样，我们 用对应的生成元(4.59)式来表示共轭动量密度： 共轭动量密度π(x) →关于场自身平移的生成元：−i ∂ ∂Φ(x) 后面会看到量子场论与这里处理的稍稍不同，而现在的处理已经 足够了。 就像上一节讨论的那样，我们需要给算符一些作用的对象。这 里同样使用抽象的Ψ，后面的章节会具体说明。同样可以得到一 个针对量子场论6十分重要的方程。\n\n6 最后一步的时候我们类似 ∂xi ∂xj = δij 给出delta 分布 [Φ(x),π(y)]Ψ = \u0014 Φ(x), −i ∂ ∂Φ(y)\n\n\u0015 Ψ\n\n∂f(xi) ∂f(xj) = δ(xi −xj)，它实际 上可以严格的说明的。更具体的 内容请看附录D.2。\n\n= |{z} 莱布尼兹律 \u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018\u0018 −iΦ(x) Ψ ∂Φ(y)+ \b\b\b\b\b\b iΦ(x) Ψ ∂Φ(y) + i \u0012∂Φ(x)\n\n\u0013 Ψ = iδ(x −y)Ψ\n\n∂Φ(y) (5.5) 同样的，由于这个式子对任意的Ψ 都成立，可以写成： [Φ(x), π(y)] = iδ(x −y) (5.6) 类似的，对于场有多于一个分量的情况，我们有 [Φi(x), πj(y)] = iδ(x −y)δij (5.7) 后面我们会看到，几乎所有的量子场论的内容都要从这个简 单的方程出发。\n\n6. Free Theory 自由场理论 本章建立自由体系的物理理论，也就是说无相互作用的情况 1 尽管这里针对的是场，后面会 看到这里得到的方程同样可以用 来处理粒子 下的对称性给出的场1。我们会\n\n• 利用Lorentz 群的(0, 0) 表示给出Klein-Gordon 方程\n\n• 利用Lorentz 群的(1 2, 0) ⊕(0, 1 2) 表示给出Dirac 方程\n\n• 利用Lorentz 群的矢量(1 2, 1 2) 表示给出Proca 方程，在无质 量极限下退化到著名的Maxwell 方程组 6.1 Lorentz Covariance and Invariance Lorentz 协变性与不 变量 本章会导出粒子物理的标准模型（这是我们拥有的最好的物 理理论）中的运动方程。我们期待这些方程在所有的惯性系中都 一样，因为如果不这样的话，每一个参考系都有各自的方程，而狭 义相对论指出并没有一个特别的参考系，所以各惯性系中方程形 式相同。这称为Lorentz 协变性。一个Lorentz 协变的对象是说 它按照某一种给定的Lorentz 群的表示来进行变换。比如说，矢 量Aµ，通过 \u0000 1 2 \u0001 表示变换，因此是Lorentz 协变的；这其实是 说，Lorentz 变换：Aµ →A′ µ，Aµ, A′ µ 实际是同一个对象（而非完 2, 1 全不同的）。另一方面，比如说，A1 + A3 就不是Lorentz 协变的， 因为它不按照Lorentz 群的某种表示来变换。但这并不是说我们 不知道它是如何变换的，因为它的变换规律从Aµ 的变换规律里 面可以简单地得出，但是在不同的惯性系中它看起来完全不一样。\n\n经推动变换到另一个惯性系之后它看起来或许像A2 + A4。只包含 100 Chapter 6. 自由场理论 Lorentz 协变的对象的方程称为Lorentz 协变方程，比如 Aµ + 7Bµ + CνAνDµ = 0 就是一个Lorentz 协变方程，因为在另一个参考系中，它看起来就 是 Dµ = A′ µ + 7B′ µ + CνAνD′ µ = 0 Aµ + 7Bµ + CνAν | {z } =一个Lorentz 标量，根据(0, 0) 表示来进行变换 它在不同惯性系看起来是一样的。只有一部分是这样的方程一般 不是Lorentz 协变的，它在另一个惯性系里面会不一样。\n\n为了导出Lorentz 协变的方程，我们要求作用量S 是Lorentz 不变的。这是说S 只能包含在参考系变换下保持不变的成分。换 句话说，作用量里面只可以包含Lorentz 变换下不变的成分。从作 2 回忆一下，我们使作用量取极 小值进而得到的欧拉-拉格朗日 方程就是系统的运动方程。\n\n用量S 中我们可以得到运动方程2。如果S 依赖于参考系，那么 运动方程就不是Lorentz 协变的了。\n\n就像前一章提到的，可以用更严格的约束条件——要求拉格 朗日量是Lorentz 不变的，这样作用量也就肯定是不变的了。\n\n6.2 Klein-Gordon Equation Klein-Gordon 方程 下面从最简单的情况开始：标量，它按照Lorentz 群的(0, 0) 表示变换。我们要找出对应的拉格朗日量来确定标量的运动方程。\n\n3 在4.2节中有所讨论：我们只考 虑0, 1 和2 阶的Φ。只考虑最低 可能的导数项的原因在后面就会 说明。\n\n符合要求的拉格朗日量的一般形式为3： L = AΦ0 + BΦ + CΦ2 + D∂µΦ + E∂µΦ∂µΦ + FΦ∂µΦ (6.1) 注意我们考虑的是拉格朗日量密度L 而不是L 本身，物理理论 从作用量 S = Z dxL (6.2) 4 分部积分产生的边界项为零， 因为在远处场很小。值得注意的 是，这是由于我们物理里面的速 度是有上限的（第2.3节）。因此， 很远处的场对于有限远的x 位置 的场不会有影响。\n\n得出，其中dx 可以理解为对时间和空间的积分。因此，诸如 Φ∂µ∂µΦ 的项实际是没必要的，因为它等效于∂µΦ∂µΦ，从分部 积分就可以直接看出4。\n\n5 考虑(4.10)式： 不仅如此，Lorentz 不变性要求拉格朗日量必须是标量。因此， 所有奇数阶的∂µ，比如∂µΦ 是禁止的。值得一提的是，如果常数，\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µΦ)\n\n\u0013 = 0\n\n∂L\n\n∂Φ −∂µ 比如a, c，有一个Lorentz 指标的话，这说明这些常数是一个4-矢 量，标定了时空的方向从而破坏了空间的各向同性。常数项实际 因此L → L + A 中的常 数项A 并不改变任何东西： ∂(L +A) 上可忽略，也就是A = 0，因为物理理论从欧拉-拉格朗日方程中 导出，因此一个常数项对运动方程没有影响5。除此之外，我们可\n\n∂Φ −∂µ \u0010 ∂(L +A)\n\n∂(∂µΦ) \u0011 =\n\n∂Φ −∂µ \u0010 ∂L ∂(∂µΦ) \u0011 .\n\n∂L 以忽略掉Φ 的线性项，也就是说B = 0，因为从欧拉-拉格朗日方 6.2 Klein-Gordon 方程 101 程中可以看出这一项只会给运动方程增加一个常数6。那么，剩下 的项就是： L = CΦ2 + E∂µΦ∂µΦ (6.3) 本章开始就指明了要建立一个自由场的理论，这意味着只有 一个Φ 而不会有形如Φ1Φ2 这种相互作用形式，这样的项在下一 章——描述相互作用的理论中考虑。\n\n还有一件事情需要注意：最后留下了两个常数C 和E，利用 变分法可以把它俩最终收为一个常数，因为拉格朗日量整体差一 个常数因子并无影响7。不仅如此，通常我们都在拉格朗日量前增 加一个1 7L →CL 得到 2，然后称另外的常数8为−m2。因此，我们最终得到了\n\n\u0012 ∂(CL )\n\n\u0013 = 0\n\n∂(CL )\n\n∂Φ −∂µ L = 1\n\n∂(∂µϕ) 2(∂µΦ∂µΦ −m2Φ2) (6.4)\n\n↕\n\n\u0012 ∂(L )\n\n\u0013 = 0\n\n∂(L ) 现在利用变分法，也就是说把拉格朗日量带入到欧拉-拉格朗\n\n∂Φ −∂µ\n\n∂(∂µϕ) 日方程(4.10)式，我们就得到了运动方程\n\n\u0012 ∂(L )\n\n\u0013 = 0 8 后面我们就会明白的看到为什 么这样称呼这个常数：它正是拉 格朗日量中的粒子质量。\n\n∂L\n\n∂Φ −∂µ\n\n∂(∂µΦ)\n\n\u0012 ∂ ∂(∂µΦ)\n\n\u00121 2(∂µΦ∂µΦ −m2Φ2) \u0013 −∂µ\n\n\u00121 2(∂µΦ∂µΦ −m2Φ2) \u0013\u0013 = 0\n\n→∂\n\n∂Φ\n\n→(∂µ∂µ + m2)Φ = 0 (6.5) 这就是著名的Klein-Gordon 方程，是描述自旋0 的自由 场/粒子的方程。\n\n6.2.1 Complex Klein-Gordon Field 复Klein-Gordon 场 对于自旋0 的场可以不用标量场的复共轭构造Lorentz 不变 的拉格朗日量。然而对于自旋1 2 场Ψ 来说就不一样了，这会带来 非常有趣的结果9。而且，我们甚至也可以像很多教科书一样研究 等价的Lorentz 不变的拉格朗日量 9 剧透：每个自旋1 2 的粒子都有 反粒子。用复数场实际上就是同 时考虑两个场，接下来会说到。因 此，我们强制的令Lorentz 不变 性同时在两个(紧密联系的) 场 上作要求，这通常就解释为粒子 和反粒子场。\n\nL = ∂µϕ†∂µϕ −m2ϕ†ϕ 这实际上与考虑两个等质量标量场的相互作用是一样的： 2m2ϕ2 1 + 1 L = 1 2∂µϕ1∂µϕ1 −1 2∂µϕ2∂µϕ2 −1 2m2ϕ2 2 因为我们有\n\nϕ ≡ 1 √ 2(ϕ1 + iϕ2) Lorentz 对称性决定了拉格朗日量的形式。基本的标量(自旋0) 粒 子非常罕见，事实上，只有Higgs 玻色子是实验上验证了的，但是 这个拉格朗日量可以描述复合系统，比如介子。因此，下面不再研 究这种拉格朗日量了，而且大多数教科书中也仅仅是用它来作为 习题。\n\n102 Chapter 6. 自由场理论 6.3 Dirac Equation Dirac 方程 Dirac 的另一个故事是他第一次遇到Feynman 的时候， 在漫长的寂静之后他说：“我有一个方程。你也有吗？”\n\n10Anthony Zee. Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell. Princeton University Press, 1st edition, 3 2003. ISBN 9780691010199\n\n—Anthony Zee10 我们这节想要研究自由的自旋1 2 场/粒子的运动方程。我们会 使用Lorentz 群的(1 2, 0) ⊕(0, 1 2) 表示，因为要描述宇称变换下的 对称性的理论必须同时有(1 2, 0) 和(0, 1 2) 表示11。而在这种对称群 11 我们在第3.7.9节中说明了， 宇称变换会把( 1 2 , 0) 表示变成 (0, 1 表示下做变换的对象称为Dirac 旋量，包括右手旋量和左手旋量。 3.7.9节讲过，Dirac 旋量定义为 2 ) 表示\n\nΨ ≡ \u0012χL ξR\n\n\u0013 = \u0012χa ξ ˙a\n\n\u0013 (6.6) 现在需要用Dirac 旋量构造某个Lorentz 不变量，从而放到 12 这里实际上有另外两种可能， 称为Majorana 质量项。我们已 经知道如何使用自旋“度规”ϵ 来 把自旋指标升或者降。我们可以 写一个Lorentz 不变的项，诸如 ϵ(ξL)†ξL，因为ϵ(ξL)† = ξa 的 形式，有一个上标的右手旋量；但 是这样写的话就会缺少自由度。 χR 和ξL 都有两个分量，因此我 们在诸如(χR)†ξL 的项里面有 四个自由度，而在ϵ(ξL)†ξL = ξaξa 中，像右手旋量一样变换的 东西并不依赖于ξL，我们从而只 有两个自由度。关于Majorana 旋量实际上还有很多可以说的， 它到现在还在进行（实验上的） 研究来确定中微子到底属于哪一 种。再多说一句，Majorana 旋 量是“实”的Dirac 旋量。这里 我打引号的原因是通常实的就 是说Ψ⋆ != Ψ。对于旋量来说， 这个条件并不Lorentz 协变（因 为Lorentz 变换的表示是复的）。 如果我们强制要求我们的标准 要求（Ψ⋆ != Ψ）的话，对于换 一个参考系这事情一般来说就 不对了。然而，我们还是给一个 对Dirac 旋量的Lorentz 协变 拉格朗日量里面。第一步是从左手旋量和右手旋量出发构造不变 量。\n\n利用在第3.7.7节介绍的Van-der-Waerden 记号。两种可能的 形式分别是12： I1 := χT ˙a ξ ˙a = (χ⋆ a)T ξ ˙a = (χa)†ξ ˙a = (χL)†ξR (6.7) 和 I2 := (ξa)T χa = ((ξa)⋆)T χa = (ξR)†χL (6.8) 3.7.7节讲过，Lorentz 不变量总是要把带点的下标和带点的上标， 或者不带点的下标和不带点的上标结合。这里再次看到右手旋量 和左手旋量需要成对出现。\n\n更进一步的，我们可以构造两种组合，其涉及到一阶导数且满 足Lorentz 协变，我们一会儿就会看到。但是首先需要理解旋量的 导数意味着什么。3.7.8节讲过如何从旋量构造4-矢量 va˙b = vνσν a˙b 其中vν 像4-矢量一样变换。因此，旋量表述下的导数算符就是\n\n∂a˙b = ∂νσν a˙b (6.9) 的“实”条件： \u0012 0 ϵ −ϵ 0\n\n\u0013 Ψ⋆ != 惯例上会定义¯σ0 = I2×2, ¯σi = −σi，因此我们可以构建Lorentz 不变的项\n\nΨ，二者通常诠释为电荷共轭。这 种诠释在第7.1.5中会进行解释。 因此，Majorana 旋量实际上描 述的是一种粒子，它的电荷共轭 粒子，通常叫反粒子，就是它自 己。Majorana 粒子是自己的反粒 子，而Majorana 旋量就是Dirac 旋量再加一个附加条件：ΨM ≡ \u0012 ξL ϵξ⋆ L I3 := (χ˙a)T ∂µ(σµ)˙abχb =

简单了。考虑一个任意的矢量场Aµ，然后构造所有符合第4.2节约 束的Lorentz 不变的项。我们必须结合下标和上标，因为我们在 第2.4节定义的Minkowski 空间的标量积是这样的，而标量才是拉 格朗日量里面需要的。可能的不变量有20 20 由于可以分部积分，我们再一 次扔掉了∂µ∂µAνAν 这项，而 仅留着∂µAν∂µAν。\n\nI1 = ∂µAν∂µAν , I2 =

来测量电子。因此，下一章将推导描述不同的场/粒子之间相互作 用的拉格朗日量。\n\n7. Interaction Theory 相互作用理论 Summary 总结 在这一章中我们将导出不同的场之间的相互作用。例如描述 电子是如何和光子作用的1。\n\n1 从另外一个视角看：电子（自 旋 1 2 且有质量）场如何和光子 （自旋为1）场作用。\n\n内禀对称性，或者这里叫做规范2 对称性，能指引我们得到拉 格朗日量的正确形式。我们将从局域3U(1) 对称性出发来得到拉格 2 马上就会解释这个奇怪的名字 朗日量 3 这意味着不仅仅是一个eiα，而 是在每一个时空点上作用一个不 同的因子，数学上写作eiα(x)。或 者这样说：变换参数α = α(x) 现在是x 的函数，在不同的时空 点上有不同的值。\n\nL = −m¯ΨΨ+i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ+Aµ ¯ΨγµΨ+∂µAν∂µAν −∂µAν∂νAµ， 即量子电动力学(quantum electrodynamics) 的拉格朗日量。 这个拉格朗日量描述了有电荷有质量的场和无质量自旋为1 的场 （光子场）之间的相互作用。只有在排除了形如mAµAµ 的“质量 项”后（这和用Aµ 来描述的光子是无质量的实验事实相符），拉 格朗日量才是局域U(1) 不变的1。利用Noether 定理，我们能从 U(1) 对称性中导出一个新的守恒量，它一般称为电荷(electric charge)。\n\n接下来是SU(2) 对称性。引入一个二分量的二重态(doublet)\n\n¯Ψ := \u0000 ¯ψ1 ¯ψ2 \u0001 ， 这样一个二重态场中包含了两个自旋1 2 场，例如，电子和电子中 微子场在SU(2) 的“旋转”变换下相互转换。\n\n我们可以使用二重态记号写下局域SU(2) 不变的拉格朗日 量4 4W µν j 这玩意会通过三个W µ j 定义，就像从U(1) 规范场Aµ 1译注：应该为“只有这样才是且仅是”。\n\n定义Fµν 一样。\n\n108 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 L = i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + ¯ΨγµσjW µ j Ψ −1 2(Wµν)i(W µν)i， 其中包含了三个自旋为1 的场W µ j 。由于SU(2) 群的生成元有 三个基Ji = σi/2，所以我们需要三个场来保证拉格朗日量是局 域SU(2) 不变的。我们将看到局域SU(2) 对称性仅当形如m¯ΨΨ、 mWµW µ 的质量项（其中质量m 是任意给定矩阵）不存在时才有 可能实现，这是因为Ψ 现在是二分量对象了。所以此时不仅自旋 为1 的场W µ j 得是无质量的了，自旋1 2 场也一样。另外一种可能 是两个自旋1 2 等质量场，但是它被实验否决了：电子质量远大于 电子中微子质量。除此之外，我们从实验知道三个自旋为1 的场 W µ j 不是无质量的。这常解释成SU(2) 对称性被破缺了。\n\n这是随后被引入的Higgs 机制(Higgs formalism) 的想法 来源。这个机制能使我们得到一个包含质量项的SU(2) 不变的拉 格朗日量。它通过引入一个与零自旋场，即Higgs 场，的相互作用 来达成目标。相同的机制使我们能给自旋1 2 场加上任意的质量项 以与实验相符。最后的相互作用拉格朗日量描述了一种新的相互 作用：弱相互作用(weak interaction)，由三个5有质量自旋为1 5 准确的讲：我们从U(1) ⊗ SU(2) 对称破缺到U(1)。这 个过程产生了三个有质量矢量 bosons：W +、W −、Z，和一个 无质量矢量bosons：γ 光子。所 以说为什么常讲电磁学（来自 U(1) 对称性）和弱相互作用理 论（来自SU(2)）是统一的。一 开始的U(1) 对称性和最后留下 来的U(1) 对称性不是一个东西。 光子和Z-Bosons 可以看做是两 个矢量Bosons 的线性组合，常 记做B 和W 3，用以使拉格朗日 量具有局域U(1)（B-bosons）和 SU(2)（W 1、W 2、W 3-bosons） 不变性。\n\n的场：W +、W −和Z, 作为传播媒介。利用Noether 定理，我们 能从SU(2) 对称性得到一个新的守恒量：同位旋(isospin)，它相 当于于电磁相互作用中的电荷，是弱相互作用中的荷。\n\n最后，我们将考虑内禀SU(3) 对称，它将会将我们能描述一 类新的相互作用，强相互作用(strong interaction)，的拉格朗 日量。为此我们将引入一个三重态\n\n\n\n\n\n q1 q2 q3\n\n， Q = 在SU(3) 下变换，包含三个自旋1 2 场。这三个自旋1 2 场被解释为 有不同颜色(color) 的夸克(quarks)，这是电磁作用中的电荷、 或者弱作用中的同位旋在强相互作用中的对应物。一样，质量项 6 数字8 源于SU(3) 的生成元 有8 个基。\n\n7 作为补充，我们从实验知道 SU(3) 的三重态中的场有相同 的质量。这是个好消息，因为局 域SU(3) 对称性禁止形如m ¯QQ 这样带有任意质量矩阵m 的项 是被禁止的，但这次和实验结论一致：8 个相应的bosons6，称为 胶子，是无质量的7。根据实验我们知道只有夸克（自旋1 2）和胶 子（自旋为1）携带颜色。最后，拉格朗日量的结果是 存在，但允许¯Q \u0012m 0 0 m\n\n\u0013 Q 这 L = −1 4F A αβF αβ A + ¯Q(iDµγµ −m)Q， 样一项，这代表三重态里的项有 相同的质量。由此局域SU(3) 不 变性不会在拉格朗日量的质量项 上造成新的障碍，SU(3) 对称也 不没有被破缺。\n\n咱仅仅引用一下装个逼，因为推导太繁琐了，并且和我们之前做 过的完全类似。\n\n总结一下： 7.1 U(1) 相互作用 109 U(1) → 1 个规范场 → 无质量光子 → 电荷 SU(2) → 3 个规范场 → 有质量W- 和Z-bosons （需要Higgs ）→ 同位旋 SU(3) → 8 个规范场 → 无质量胶子 → 色荷 7.1 U(1) Interaction U(1) 相互作用 为了得到拉格朗日量中正确的相互作用项，我们得使用内禀 对称性，或者称作规范对称性(gauge symmetries)。规范对称 这个叫法有一些历史上的原因，和我们现在要讨论的东西之间关 系不是太大。Weyl 曾尝试将电磁学8“作为时空对称性的结果，特 8Frank Wilczek. Riemann-einstein structure from volume and gauge symmetry. Phys. Rev. Lett., 80:4851–4854, Jun 1998. doi: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.4851 别是在局域尺度变换下的对称性”。将其称作规范对称性是有原因 的，因为它意味着，例如，我们能任意改变用于定义长度标准的铂 金尺（用来规范2实验中测长的仪器），而不改变物理。这个尝试没 有成功，但稍晚些时候，Weyl 找到了能正确导出电磁学的对称性， 并仍用这个词来命名。\n\n7.1.1 自旋1 2 自由场的内禀对称性 再来看一眼用来导出自由自旋1 2 理论的拉格朗日量（(6.16)式） LDirac = −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ = ¯Ψ(iγµ∂µ −m)Ψ (7.1) 它是在Lorentz 对称性的要求下导出的，但如果我们仔细观察它， 能发现这个拉格朗日量中蕴含着另一个对称性。拉格朗日量在场\n\nΨ 的如下变换下不变\n\nΨ →Ψ′ = eiaΨ\n\n⇒¯Ψ →¯Ψ′ = Ψ′†γ0 = (eiaΨ)†γ0 = ¯Ψe−ia， (7.2) 9 别忘了¯Ψ = Ψ†γ0 其中负号来源于复共轭9，而a 是一个任给实数。为了看清这一点， 我们将变换后的场的拉格朗日量明确写出 L ′ Dirac = −m¯Ψ′Ψ′ + i¯Ψ′γµ∂µΨ′\n\n= −m(¯Ψe−ia)(eiaΨ) + i(¯Ψe−ia)γµ∂µ(eiaΨ)\n\n= −m¯ΨΨ e−iaeia | {z } =1 +i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ e−iaeia | {z } =1 = −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ = LDirac, (7.3) 10 技术上讲：一个复数和所有矩 阵（例如γµ）对易。\n\n其中我们利用了eia 仅是一个复数这一点来将它自由前后挪动10。 回忆我们在第3章中曾讲过的，任何单位复数（能写作eia 的形式） 2译注：没有规矩，不成方圆。线长是某个线性空间中的某种范数，将改变线 长的定义的变换，称作规范变换，应当是一个合理的称呼。关于gauge 这个词 的命名以及为何翻译成“规范”，可以参见曹则贤. Norm and Gauge[J]. 物理, 2013, 42(11): 815-819. 110 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 构成了一个U(1) 群，由此可以将我们刚才发现的事实用数学语言 表达出来：拉格朗日量是U(1) 不变的。由于它丝毫不涉及时空的 变换而只改变场自身，所以说这是一个内禀对称性。猛地一看，这 玩意还挺萌的，但好像没什么用。不要走开，稍后的节目会告诉你 它有多精彩！\n\n现在咱再来钻深一点。我们刚展示了，给我们的场乘一个任意 单位复数什么都不会改变。这个对称变换Ψ →Ψ′ = eiaΨ 叫做全 局(global) 变换，因为我们在每一个点x 给场Ψ = Ψ(x) 乘上了 一个相同的因子eia。 但是，为什么一个时空点的相位因子会和另一个时空点的相 关呢？一个点的选取不应该瞬间改变整个宇宙的情况。这是挺奇 怪的，因为正如2.4节中所述，狭义相对论告诉我们没有信息能比 光传播得更快。而全局对称性选择会瞬间应用到在整个宇宙中的 每一个点上3。 让我们来检查一下，如果给每一个时空点变换一个不同的因 子a = a(x)，拉格朗日量是不是还是不变的。这叫做局域(local) 变换。\n\n作变换\n\nΨ →Ψ′ = eia(x)Ψ\n\n⇒¯Ψ →e−ia(x) ¯Ψ, (7.4) 现在a = a(x) 依赖于坐标了，我们得到变换后的拉格朗日量11 11 可能你会好奇包含全部可能 导数项的拉格朗日量（由简洁 性的要求被忽略）是不是局域 U(1) 不变的：L = −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + i(∂µΨ)γµΨ。你 可以检查一下，这个拉格 朗日量自然是局域U(1) 不 变的，但注意第二项和第三 项之和为零：i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + i(∂µΨ)γµΨ = |{z} 分部积分 i(∂µΨ)γµΨ − L ′ Dirac = −m¯Ψ′Ψ′ + i¯Ψ′γµ∂µΨ′\n\n= −m(¯Ψ e−ia(x))(eia(x) | {z } =1\n\nΨ) + i(¯Ψe−ia(x))γµ∂µ(eia(x)Ψ)\n\n= −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ e−iaeia | {z } =1 + |{z} 莱布尼兹律 i(e−ia(x) ¯Ψ)γµΨ(∂µeia(x))\n\n= −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + i2(∂µa(x))¯ΨγµΨ ̸= LDirac (7.5) i(∂µΨ)γµΨ = 0。包含了全 部可能导数的正确拉格朗日量 的两导数项间必须有一个相 对负号：LDirac = −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ −i(∂µΨ)γµΨ，故它 并不是局域U(1) 不变的。\n\n由于莱布尼兹律导致了一个额外的项，所以说我们的拉格朗日量 在局域U(1) 对称变换下不是不变的。但按照上面所讨论的，拉格 朗日量应该是局域不变的，在这里却不是。这里有一些事情可做， 但我们得先研究另一种对称性。\n\n7.1.2 自旋为1 自由场的内禀对称性 接下来，来看看自旋为一的粒子12 12 见(6.25)式，注意我们为了简 明起见而丢掉的1 2 因子 LProca = ∂µAν∂µAν −∂µAν∂νAµ + m2AµAµ。 (7.6) 3译注：引入局域规范的另一种讲法是，我们不能保证外星人里物理学家和我 们选取同一套规范（这里的a 是可以随意选取的，但是必须要选取一个才能得 到完整的理论。a 的选取被称为规范的选取），但是物理定律不应该有区别。\n\n7.1 U(1) 相互作用 111 这儿也能找到一个全局内禀对称性。如果我们作变换 Aµ →A′ µ = Aµ + aµ (7.7) 其中aµ 为任意常数，拉格朗日量变为 L ′ Proca = ∂µA′ν∂µA′ ν −∂µA′ν∂νA′ µ + m2A′µA′ µ = ∂µ(Aν + aν)∂µ(Aν + aν) −∂µ(Aν + aν)∂ν(Aµ + aµ) + m2(Aµ + aµ)(Aµ + aµ)\n\n= ∂µAν∂µAν −∂µAν∂νAµ + m2(Aµ + aµ)(Aµ + aµ) (7.8) 由此我们作出结论，对于无质量场（m = 0），这个变换是个全局 对称的变换。\n\n那局域对称性又会怎么样呢？作变换 Aµ →A′ µ = Aµ + aµ(x) (7.9) 无质量的拉格朗日量变成 L ′ Maxwell = ∂µA′ν∂µA′ ν −∂µA′ν∂νA′ µ = ∂µ(Aν + aν(x))∂µ(Aν + aν(x)) −∂µ(Aν + aν(x))∂ν(Aµ + aµ(x))\n\n= ∂µAν∂µAν + ∂µaν(x)∂µAν + ∂µAν∂µaν(x) + ∂µaν(x)∂µaν(x)\n\n−∂µAν∂νAµ −∂µAν∂νaµ(x) −∂µaν(x)∂νAµ −∂µaν(x)∂νaµ(x) (7.10) 即没有内禀对称性。\n\n然而，如果作变换Aµ →A′ µ + ∂µa(x)，我们能弄出一个局域 内禀对称性来。这意味着我们加的是一个任意函数的导数，而不 是一个任意函数。这会导致4 L ′ Maxwell = ∂µA′ν∂µA′ ν −∂µA′ν∂νA′ µ = ∂µ(Aµ + ∂νa(x))∂µ(Aν + ∂νa(x))\n\n−∂µ(Aν + ∂νa(x))∂ν(Aµ + ∂µa(x))\n\n= ∂µAν∂µAν + ∂µ(∂νa(x))∂µAν + ∂µAν∂µ∂νa(x)\n\n+ ∂µ∂νa(x)∂µ∂νa(x)\n\n−∂µAν∂νAµ −∂µAν∂ν(∂µa(x)) −∂µ(∂νa(x))∂νAµ −∂µ(∂νa(x))∂ν(∂µa(x))\n\n= |{z} ∂ν∂µ=∂µ∂ν以及重命名哑指标 ∂µAν∂µAν −∂µAν∂νAµ = LMaxwell (7.11) 所以说这里的确有一个局域内禀对称变换。这看上去也像是一个 技术细节。好的，我们找到了一些局域的、内禀的对称性，然后呢？\n\n4译注：原文缺少一个(x) 112 Chapter 7.

才是一个局域对称性。\n\n这两坨奇怪的东西看上去真该加在一起：拉格朗日量中的一个额 外项Aµ ¯ΨγµΨ 会变换作 Aµ ¯ΨγµΨ →(Aµ+∂µa(x))¯ΨγµΨ = Aµ ¯ΨγµΨ+∂µa(x)¯ΨγµΨ (7.14) 比较(7.12) 式中的第二项5。拉格朗日量中这个将Ψ、¯Ψ 和Aµ 耦 合在一起的新项，正好能干掉那个不自量力阻挡自旋1 2 自由场拥 有局域U(1) 不变性的家伙。换言之：通过添加这个新项使得拉格 朗日量局域U(1) 不变。\n\n再来仔细研究一下这件事。首先习惯上都会在局域U(1) 变换 的指数上添一个常数因子g：eiga(x)。这样额外项变成\n\n−(∂µa(x))¯ΨγµΨ →−g(∂µa(x))¯ΨγµΨ。 (7.15) 正如我们下面将看到的，这个额外的因子g 代表一个任意的耦合 常数13g。将这个新项 13 耦合常数总能告诉我们相互 作用的强度是多少。这里讨论的 是电磁相互作用，g 代表着它的 强度。\n\ngAµ ¯ΨγµΨ 2 自由场的拉格朗日量上，其中γµ 用来保证这一项 的Lorentz 不变性，否则带有一个自由指标µ 的Aµ 和拉格朗 加到自旋1 日量密度这个标量无法匹配，另外也插入了耦合常数(coupling constant)14g。这样拉格朗日量 14 我们能看到这里g 决定了Ψ、 ¯Ψ 和Aµ 耦合在一起的强度。\n\nLDirac+ 额外项= −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + gAµ ¯ΨγµΨ。\n\n7.1 U(1) 相互作用 113 依据Ψ、¯Ψ 和Aµ 局域变换的规则来变换这个拉格朗日量，得到15 L ′ Dirac+ 额外项= −m¯Ψ′Ψ′ + i¯Ψ′γµ∂µΨ′ + gA′ µ ¯Ψ′γµΨ′\n\n= |{z} 见(7.5)式 −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ −g(∂µa(x))¯ΨγµΨ + gA′ µ ¯Ψ′γµΨ′\n\n= −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ −g(∂µa(x))¯ΨγµΨ\n\n+ g(Aµ + ∂µa(x))(e−iga(x) ¯Ψ)γµ(eiga(x)Ψ)\n\n= −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ −(((((((( g(∂µa(x))¯ΨγµΨ\n\n+ gAµ ¯ΨγµΨ +(((((((( g(∂µa(x))¯ΨγµΨ\n\n= −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + gAµ ¯ΨγµΨ = LDirac+ 额外项。\n\n(7.16) 由此，在加上一个额外项后，我们得到了，正如所期待的，一 个局域U(1) 不变的拉格朗日量。为了描述一个包含了包含有质量 自旋1 2 场和无质量自旋为一的场的系统，我们必须将无质量自旋 为一的自由场的拉格朗日量也加到拉格朗日量中来。这样就得到 了完整的拉格朗日量 LDirac+ 额外项+Maxwell = −m¯ΨΨ+i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ+gAµ ¯ΨγµΨ+∂µAν∂µAν−∂µAν∂νAµ。\n\n(7.17) 为了方便起见，引入记号 Dµ ≡i∂µ + gAµ， (7.18) 称作协变导数(covariant derivative)6。这样拉格朗日量写作 LDirac+ 额外项+Maxwell = −m¯ΨΨ + ¯Ψγµ (i∂µ + gAµ) | {z } ≡Dµ Ψ + ∂µAν∂µAν\n\n= −∂µAν∂νAµ −m¯ΨΨ + ¯ΨγµDµΨ + ∂µAν∂µAν −∂µAν∂νAµ (7.19) 这即为电磁场的量子场论（常称为量子电动力学）的正确拉格朗 日量。我们通过观察自旋1 2 自由场和自旋为一的自由场的内禀对 称性，简单的得到了它。 我们将要回答的下一个问题是：这个拉格朗日量会导致什么 样的运动方程？\n\n7.1.4 非齐次麦克斯韦方程和最小耦合 谜底揭晓：这个拉格朗日量给出有电流情况下的非齐次Maxwell 方程组。 推导是很直白的：将拉格朗日量7 LDirac+ 额外项+Maxwell = −m¯ΨΨ+i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ+gAµ ¯ΨγµΨ+∂µAν∂µAν−∂µAν∂νAµ 5译注：此处疑引用有误 6译注：常见的记号似乎与其差了一个虚数单位

办法得到的，即当外场存在时，导数∂µ 应当换成协变导数8\n\n∂µ →Dµ = i∂µ + Aµ (7.23) 来导出正确的方程。“最小”这个词的意思是，这里只用了一个规 范场Aµ 的四个分量9。\n\n现在我们有了用来描述Dirac 旋量在外加电磁场中的行为的 方程((7.21)式)，所以说可以来兑现在3.7.10节中许下的承诺了。在 那儿我们宣称电荷共轭变换（充满暗示的名字）改变其描述对象的 电荷。换言之，如果Ψ 描述带电荷+e 的某些东西，而电荷共轭 旋量ΨC 描述带电荷−e 的某些东西。电荷决定了自旋1 2 粒子/场 和外加自旋为一的场的耦合强度，我们将考虑ΨC 的运动方程是 什么。之后我们将谈谈第三个方程，(7.22)式。\n\n7.1.5 再一次电荷共轭变换 为了得到对应的方程，我们需要找到Dirac 旋量的电荷共轭 变换算符确切的形式。我们在3.7.10节中得到了变换（(3.236)式）\n\nΨ = \u0012χL ξR\n\n\u0013 →ΨC = \u0012ξL χR\n\n\u0013 。 (7.24) 这个变换可以简单地用一个γµ 矩阵来描述。利用(6.13)式中γ2 的 定义，我们有\n\nΨC = iγ2Ψ∗= i \u0012 0 σ2 −σ2 0\n\n\u0013 \u0012χ∗ L ξ∗ R\n\n\u0013 ， (7.25) 8译注：此处虚单位i 的位置似有不妥，同后文 9译注：否则，我们可以使用张量场¯ΨσµνF µνΨ 7.1 U(1) 相互作用 115 利用iσ2 = ϵ 正好就是旋量度规，改写作\n\n= \u0012 0 ϵ −ϵ 0\n\n\u0013 \u0012χ∗ L ξ∗ R\n\n\u0013 = \u0012 ϵξ∗ R −ϵχ∗ L\n\n\u0013 。 (7.26) 等价于\n\n= \u0012ξL χR\n\n\u0013 ， (7.27) 正如3.7.7节，特别是(3.194)式中展示的一样。故我们从(7.21)式开 始： (iγµ∂µ−m)Ψ−gAµγµΨ = (γµ(i∂µ −gAµ) −m) Ψ = 0，(7.28) 并取其复共轭，作为得到ΨC 的方程的第一步：\n\n→ \u0000 γ∗ µ(−i∂µ −gAµ) −m \u0001 Ψ∗= 0。 (7.29) 然后左乘一个γ2，并在Ψ 前插入一个1 = γ−1 2 γ2：\n\n→γ2 \u0000 γ∗ µ(−i∂µ −gAµ) −m \u0001 γ−1 2 γ2 | {z } =1\n\nΨ∗= 0。 (7.30) (−i∂µ −gAµ) −mγ2γ−1 2 )γ2Ψ∗= 0。 (7.31)\n\n→(γ2γ∗ µγ−1 2 | {z } =−γµ\n\n→ |{z} 方程乘上i (−γµ(−i∂µ −gAµ) −m) iγ2Ψ∗ | {z } =ΨC见(7.25)式\n\n= 0。 (7.32)\n\n→(γµ(i∂µ + gAµ) −m) ΨC = 0， (7.33) 这和Ψ 的运动方程只在耦合常数上差了个负号g →−g。这与其 16 注意ΨC ̸= ¯Ψ。ΨC = iγ2Ψ∗ 名字，电荷共轭，相符16。\n\n而¯Ψ = Ψ†γ0 = (Ψ∗)T γ0。电荷 共轭变换让我们能用反粒子来解 释一些东西，稍后便会详细讨论。\n\n接下来，我们转向上一节中的第三个式子，(7.22)式，称为有 电流情况下的非齐次麦克斯韦方程(inhomogeneous Maxwell equation in the presence of an electric current)。为了讲清 楚这个名字，我们又需要Noether 定理了。\n\n7.1.6 内禀U(1) 对称性的Noether 定理 在4.5.5节中我们得知Noether 定理将所有内禀对称性和一个 守恒量联系了起来。和我们刚才发现的U(1) 对称性相联系的守恒 量是什么？Noether 定理告诉我们，从如下形式的变换\n\nΨ →Ψ′ = Ψ + δΨ 能导出Noether 流 Jµ = ∂L ∂(∂µΨ)δΨ 116 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 其满足连续性方程\n\n∂µJµ = 0。 (7.34) 一个全局17U(1) 变换是\n\nΨ →Ψ′ = eiga = (1 + iga + . . . )Ψ 如通常所做的那样，我们仅将指数函数展开到第一项，因为U(1) 是一个Lie 群，而任意变换都可以由无穷小的来生成。一个无穷小 的变换写作\n\nΨ →Ψ′ = Ψ + igaΨ 故我们有δΨ = igaΨ。就如4.5.5节中所做的一样，导出Noether 流 Jµ = ∂L ∂(∂µΨ)δΨ\n\n= ∂(−m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ)\n\n∂(∂µΨ) igaΨ\n\n= −¯ΨγµgaΨ = −ga¯ΨγµΨ。 (7.35) 由于连续性方程对于任意a 都成立，故略去18任意的常数因子a。 故，我们定义 Jµ = −g ¯ΨγµΨ (7.36) 18 保留常数g，它的值由实验决 定，而不是任意选取的。\n\n这常被称作四电流(electric four-current)。零分量正是电荷密 度，其空间积分对时间守恒19 Q = Z d3x ρ |{z} 电荷密度\n\n= Z d3x J0 = −g Z d3x¯Ψγ0Ψ (7.37) 在量子框架下，Ψ 和概率幅相关，有要求 R d3x ¯Ψγ0Ψ = 1，即总 概率必须为100% = 1。所以说守恒量实际就是耦合强度g，在电 19 类似的推导参见(4.39)式。\n\n磁作用意义下正比于电荷。所以，全局U(1) 对称性导致了电荷守 恒。\n\n注意(7.22)式，我们可以借助(7.36)式将其改写成\n\n∂σ(∂σAρ −∂ρAσ) + g ¯ΨγρΨ | {z } =−Jρ = 0\n\n→∂σ(∂σAρ −∂ρAσ) = Jρ。 (7.38) 借助(6.22)式中定义的电磁张量，改写作\n\n∂σF ρσ = Jρ。 (7.39) 这即是在有电流情况下的非齐次Maxwell 方程组。这些方程 组20，和非齐次Maxwell 方程组（可以由F ρσ 的定义直接得到21） 一起，是经典电动力学的基础。 接下来我们将快速的过一遍有质量自旋为一的场和零自旋场 的相互作用。\n\n7.1 U(1) 相互作用 117 7.1.7 零自旋有质量场的相互作用 注意我们导出的零自旋场的拉格朗日量 L = 1 2(∂µΦ∂µΦ −m2Φ2) 不是U(1) 不变的，做变换Φ →Φ′ = eiaΦ 看一下就知道了。 但是，复标量理论 L = 1 2(∂µΦ∗∂µΦ −m2Φ∗Φ) (7.40) 具有U(1) 对称性，因为有Φ →Φ′ = eiaΦ 及Φ∗→(Φ∗)′ = e−iaΦ∗。\n\n所以我们有机会像7.1节中对自旋1 2 理论所做的那样，导出一个相 互作用理论。推导完全是类似的22，结果是 22 正确的拉格朗日量可以仅通 过做替换∂µ →Dµ = i∂µ + Aµ 来得到 2 \u0000 ((∂µ −iqAµ)Φ∗) ((∂µ + iqAµ)Φ) −m2Φ∗Φ \u0001 (7.41) L = 1 代入拉格朗日方程\n\n\u0012 ∂L ∂(∂µΦ)\n\n\u0013 = 0\n\n∂L\n\n∂Φ

有质量场和自旋为1 无质量场的相互作用也可以简 单的由对称性得到。自旋为1 无质量场的拉格朗日量为 LMaxwell = 1 4F µνFµν。\n\n为了区分有质量场和无质量场，我们将有质量场命名为Bµ，并定 义 Gµν := ∂µBν −∂νBµ 自旋为1 的有质量场的拉格朗日量写作（(6.19)式） LProca = 1 2GµνGµν + m2BµBµ Lorentz 对称性表明拉格朗日量中的相互作用项一定具有形式 LProcal-相互作用= CGµνF µν 其中耦合常数C 需要由实验来定。感兴趣的读者可以借助欧拉-拉 格朗日方程自行推导相应的运动方程。\n\n10译注：下式符号有误，已更正 118 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 7.2 SU(2) Interactions SU(2) 相互作用 U(1) 对称性的成功激励着我们提出这个问题：U(1) 对称性是 我们的拉格朗日量唯一的内禀对称性吗？\n\n事实上，我们能够在两个无质量自旋1 2 粒子上找到另一个内 禀对称性。将6.3节中得到的拉格朗日量作两份加在一起，就是两 个无质量自旋1 2 粒子的拉格朗日量了。最后的结果即(6.16)式： LDirac = ¯ψ(iγµ∂µ −m)ψ。\n\n这里我们将质量项略去，即m = 0，否则马上就能看到拉格朗日 量不是变换不变的。再之后将看到我们是怎么在不破坏对称性的 情况下把质量项捡回来的。“作两份加在一起”指的是 LD1+D2 = i ¯ψ1γµ∂µψ1 + i ¯ψ2γµ∂µψ2 (7.44) 通过新定义二重态(doublet)Ψ\n\n\u0013\n\nΨ := \u0012ψ1 ψ2\n\n→¯Ψ := \u0000 ¯ψ1 ¯ψ2 \u0001 我们能将前式改写成 LD1+D2 =

群的常用生成元，σi 是泡利矩阵。\n\n为了看明白不变性，我们将变换后的拉格朗日量写出2311 m := \u0012m1 0 0 m2\n\n\u0013 L ′ D1+D2 = i¯Ψ′γµ∂µΨ′\n\n= i¯Ψe−iai σi 2 γµ∂µeiai σi (7.48) 2 Ψ 写作\n\n= i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ = LD1+D2， ✓ LD1+D2 = −¯ΨmΨ。\n\n最后一行源于我们的变换eiai σi 2 作用在我们的新定义的二分量对 不幸的是，这一项并不 是 SU(2) 不变的，即 L ′ D1+D2 = −¯Ψ′mΨ′ = 象Ψ 上，而γµ 作用在二重态里面的对象上，即Dirac 旋量12。我 们可以用指标来将其写清楚13 i¯Ψ e−iai σi 2 meiai σi 2 | {z } ̸=m Ψ。当质量 h\u0010 e−iai

会有更加详细的讨论。\n\n11译注：原文边注公式缺一′，已更正 12译注：用线性代数的话来讲，两个变换分别作用在两个子空间上，而这两个 子空间的直积才是二重态所处的线性空间。\n\n13译注：指标真尼玛多。\n\n7.2 SU(2) 相互作用 119 这个对称性也该作为局域对称性。SU(2) 变换将二重态的两 个分量混合起来。稍后我们将会将这两个场称作电子和电子中微 子场。对称性告诉我们，把哪个叫电子哪个叫电子中微子其实无所 谓，因为用了SU(2) 变换，想怎么换就怎么换。如果这仅仅是一 个全局变换，那么当我们确定一个选择24，即哪个叫电子哪个叫电 24 这叫规范选取(choosing a gauge)。\n\n子中微子后，这个选择将瞬间适用到整个宇宙上去。故我们得研 究局域变换。我们再一次发现它不是的，但正如局域U(1) 对称性 的情形一样，我们将尽最大努力让拉格朗日量具有局域SU(2) 不 变性。 问题依旧出在求导上，这会导致额外项： L ′ D1+D2 = i¯Ψ′γµ∂µΨ′\n\n= i¯Ψe−iai(x) σi 2 γµ∂µeiai(x) σi 2 Ψ\n\n= |{z} 莱布尼兹律 i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ −¯Ψγµ \u0010 ∂µai(x)σi\n\n\u0011 Ψ ̸= LD1+D2。\n\n2 (7.49) 有着7.1节中处理U(1) 的经验，我们很清楚接下来该做什么。我们 将一步一步的导出一个局域SU(2) 不变的拉格朗日量，这会花一 些时间。为了避免读者陷入迷惑，在这里先列出接下来要进行的 步骤：\n\n\u0013 和三个有 2 场 \u0012ψ1 ψ2\n\n• 最后的结论是，加上用以描述两个自旋1 质量自旋为1 的场W µ i 相互作用的额外项i¯ΨγµW µ i σiΨ 后， 拉格朗日量成为局域SU(2) 不变的。 • 注意，不变性仅当按照下式变换 (Wµ)i →(W ′ µ)i = (Wµ)i + ∂µai(x) + ϵijkaj(x)(Wµ)k 而不是 (Wµ)i →(W ′ µ)i = (Wµ)i + ∂µai(x)， 即不同于U(1) 对称性时的情况。\n\n• 仅当自由场拉格朗日量为如下形式14 L = 1 4(Wµν)i(W µν)i 其中 (Wµν)i = ∂µ(Wν)i −∂ν(Wµ)i + ϵijk(Wµ)j(Wν)k 而不是 (Wµν)i = ∂µ(Wν)i −∂ν(Wµ)i。\n\n14译注：原文字体错误，已更正。\n\n120 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 时，对称性才存在。换言之，为了得到一个局域SU(2) 不变 的拉格朗日量，我们必须重新定义三个W µ i 场的拉格朗日 量，使得其在变换 (Wµ)i →(W ′ µ)i = (Wµ)i + ∂µai(x) + ϵijkaj(x)(Wµ)k 下不变。\n\n现在我们来具体执行这些步骤。从(7.11)式中我们得知自旋为 1 的场有内禀对称性 Aµ →A′ µ = Aµ + ∂µa(x) 而这里我们将会使用三个自旋为1 的场W µ 1 , W µ 2 和W µ 3 ，这是因 为SU(2) 有三个生成元σi 2 ，由指数上的求和ai(x)σi 2 产生的每一

对称性被破坏，我们不能往拉 格朗日量中添加形如m1 ¯ΨΨ 或m2(Wµ)i(W µ)i 的质量项。而从实 验中我们知道相应的粒子26却有质量，这常被解释为SU(2) 对称 26 例如，由Ψ 描述的电子e− 和电子中微子νe，以及由(Wµ)i 描述的三个bosons 。\n\n性的破缺。这意味着对称性在高能标下存在，而在低能标下自发 破缺。 之前我们得到了一个局域U(1) 不变的拉格朗日量，在这里为 方便起见我们将相应的自旋为1 的场记做Bµ： L局域U(1) 不变= −m ¯ψψ + ¯ψγµ(i∂µ +gBµ)ψ −1 4BµνBµν (7.59) 其中 Bµν := ∂µBν −∂νBµ 由于自旋为1 的场Bµ 能保证拉格朗日量的U(1) 不变性，所以其 常被称作U(1) 规范场。\n\n局域SU(2) 不变的拉格朗日量是27 27 之前为了简明起见略去的三

Parity Violation 宇称破坏 大自然不遵守宇称对称性，即宇称破坏，是科学史上最为重大 的发现之一。通俗地说，宇称破坏使一部分物理实验表现出与其 镜像实验所不同的物理现象。吴健雄在“吴实验”中最早发现了宇 称破坏现象。这是一个漂亮的实验，但它的具体实现与本节主题 无关，因此我们将只关注实验结果。\n\n“吴实验”发现，弱相互作用的媒介子（W +, W −, Z 玻色子） 仅与左手粒子耦合。换句话说，只有左手粒子才会通过弱作用力 相互作用，这一物理机制与宇称破坏的关系将在本节结尾处加以 解释。所有在弱相互作用中产生的粒子都是“左手”的。中微子只 参与弱相互作用，因此右手中微子可能根本不存在41。另一方面， 41 我们很快会看到，有质量的左 手粒子总会在传播过程中获得右 手分量。实验表明中微子有质量， 因此也应当包含右手分量。然而 这一右手分量不参与任何已知相 互作用。\n\n所有其它粒子都能通过另外三种相互作用产生，因此都可以具有 “右手性”。\n\n目前为止，我们用“左手性”和“右手性”，标注了对象在经 历洛伦兹变换时所依据的群表示。这是一个抽象的概念，但我们 42 此处我们不讨论这一概念，因 其细节与本节叙述的主题无关。 读者只需知道类似实验具有可行 性。更多精彩的讨论可以参见以 下文献：Alessandro Bettini. Introduction to Elementary Particle Physics. Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition, 4 2014. ISBN 9781107050402 却可以实际测量粒子的手性，因为抽象的“手性”概念直接关联于 直观的“螺度”概念42。\n\n其实在多数情况下，微观粒子并没有确定的手性，也不处于 确定的左手或右手态，而是由同时包含两种手性分量的狄拉克旋 量所描述。宇称破坏并不是理论预言，相反，它的发现震惊了整个 物理学界。即使到了今天，大自然这一奇特的性质依旧令人费解。\n\n7.4 宇称破坏 131 然而，将这一发现纳入我们的理论框架却并不困难。我们只需利 用某些数学工具，确保处理弱相互作用时只考虑左手旋量即可。 我们用χ, ξ 表示二分量外尔旋量，而ψ 代表四分量狄拉克旋 量：\n\nψ = \u0012χL ξR\n\n\u0013 (7.98)\n\nΨ 是狄拉克旋量的双重态：\n\nΨ = \u0012ψ1 ψ2\n\n\u0013 (7.99) 上面提到的“某些工具”，是投影算符PL:\n\n\u0012χL ξR\n\n\u0013 ≡ψL (7.100)\n\n\u0013 = \u0012χL 0 PLψ = PL 投影算符可以用如下矩阵构造43：\n\nγ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3 = \u0012−1 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 43 请回忆方程(6.13)中γµ 矩阵 的定义，切记并无γ4 矩阵存在。 由于另有规范以γ4 表示γ0。为 避免符号混淆，此处特将这一矩 阵记为γ5。\n\n(7.101)\n\n\u0013 或 \u0012 0 ξR\n\n\u0013 ，正是 矩阵γ5 被称为手性算符，因为单一手性态 \u0012χL 0\n\nγ5 本征值为−1 和+1 的两个本征态。 于是，投影算符PL 可以写为44 44 读者可能会问，为什么我们 要用这样复杂的方式定义PL， 而不是直接从矩阵形式出发呢？ 这样做的目的，是为了保留在 其它基下工作的可能性，那 时γµ 的矩阵形式可以非常不 同。（读者可以在8.10节中找 到更多信息）注意到拉氏量中 狄拉克旋量总与γµ 相伴出现。 在这两者之间，我们总可以插 入1 = U−1U，其中U 为任 意可逆矩阵。例如∂µ ¯ΨγµΨ = ∂µ ¯Ψ U−1U | {z } =1 γµ U−1U | {z } =1 Ψ = 2 = \u00121 0 0 0\n\n\u0013 PL = 1 −γ5 (7.102) 类似的，我们定义 2 = \u00120 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 PR = 1 + γ5 (7.103) 现在为了限制只有左手粒子参与弱相互作用，我们必须在拉氏量 中，描述各类场与W ± µ 与Zµ 相互作用的每一项里都插入PL。这 些项已在7.2节中导出，最终结果参看方程(7.58)，我们将其重写如\n\n∂µ ¯ΨU−1 | {z } = ¯Ψ′ UγµU−1 | {z } γ′µ UΨ |{z} Ψ′ 。物理事 下： L = i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + i¯ΨγµσjW µ j Ψ −1 4(Wµν)i(W µν)i (7.104) 实当然独立于这类基矢变换，我 们却可以利用它简化计算。本 书正文偏好使用的基矢，被称 为Weyl 基。在其它基矢下，狄 拉克旋量的两个分量是χL 与 ξR 的混合。尽管如此，通过 PL = 1−γ5 其中需要处理的一项是¯ΨγµσjW µ j Ψ，我们将PL 插入:\n\n→L = i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + i¯ΨγµσjW µ j PLΨ −1 4(Wµν)i(W µν)i 2 定义的投影算符， 总能将其投影为左手分量。这是 因为P Weyl L ΨWeyl = ΨWeyl L ⇒ (7.105) 此处PL 作用于双重态，得到 P ′ LΨ′ = 1−γ′ 5 2 Ψ′ |{z} UΨWeyl = PLΨ = \u0012PL 0 0 PL\n\n\u0013 \u0012ψ1 ψ2\n\n\u0013 = \u0012(ψ1)L (ψ2)L\n\n\u0013 (7.106) 1−Uiγ0U−1Uγ1U−1Uγ2U−1Uγ3U−1 2 UΨWeyl = U−Uiγ0γ1γ2γ3 我们断言，只需在表达式中插入一个PL，就可以将¯Ψ 和Ψ 同时投影到左手分量上。为了理解这一点，我们需要以下三个等 2 ΨWeyl = U \u0010 1−γ5 2 \u0011 ΨWeyl = UΨWeyl L = Ψ′ L ✓ 式： 132 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论\n\n• (PL)2 = PL，这可以从算符的矩阵形式立即看出，同时也是 45 投影算符的定义中还包括 PLPR = PRPL = 0，此处可 用PL, PR 和γ5 的矩阵形式验 证成立。\n\n投影算符必须满足的性质45。两次投影应等价于一次投影。 • {γ5, γµ} = γ5γµ + γµγ5 = 0，这可以通过简单粗暴的展开计 算加以证明46。 • (PL)† = PL，因为γ5 是实矩阵。而这一点可以从γ5 的矩阵 46 或可用定义γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3 结合以下等式证明：{γµ, γν} = γµγν +γνγµ = 1 形式直接看出γ5 = \u0012−1 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 。\n\n2 ηµν，其中ηµν 为Minkowski 度规。\n\n第二个等式直接推出γ5γµ = −γµγ5，即我们可以交换γ5 和\n\nγµ 矩阵的位置，只需加入一个额外的负号。于是我们有：\n\nγµPL = γµ 1 −γ5 2 = 1 + γ5 2 γµ = PRγµ (7.107) 现在我们可以将方程(7.105)中的相关项写为：\n\n¯ΨγµσjW µ j PLΨ = ¯ΨγµσjW µ j (PL)2Ψ\n\nσjW µ j PLΨ |{z} ΨL\n\n= ¯Ψ |{z} Ψ†γ0 γµPL | {z } PRγµ\n\n= Ψ† γ0PR | {z } PLγ0\n\nγµσjW µ j ΨL 利用P † L=PL以及(AB)†=((AB)T )∗=(BT AT

变换下这一项不具有不变性，由这一项描述的物理系统，也将和 它的“镜像”有所不同47。这里我们用到旋量48和矢量49的宇称算 47 这就是说，若一项实验的结果 全由拉氏量中的这一项所决定， 那么当实验设置全部以镜像方式 反转时，实验结果也会有所不同。\n\n符Pspinor, Pvector。在宇称变换下：\n\n¯Ψ |{z} =Ψ†γ0 γµσj(W µ j )PLΨ →(PspinorΨ)†γ0γµσj(PvectorW µ)jPL(PspinorΨ) 48 旋量宇称算符在3.7.9节中 导出。用γµ 矩阵，我们可以 将宇称算符写作P = γ0 = \u0012 0 σ0 σ0 0\n\n= (Ψ)†γ0γ0γµσj(PvectorW µ)jPLγ0Ψ\n\n\u0013 = \u00120 1 1 0\n\n\u0013 (Ψ)†γ0γ0γµσj(PvectorW µ)jPRΨ.\n\n= |{z} 利用{γ5,γ0}=0以及PL= 1−γ5 49 矢量宇称算符即为Pvector =  2\n\n (7.109) 1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1\n\n  \n\n  ，如方 我们可以通过矩阵运算得到γ0γ0γ0 = γ0 及γ0γiγ0 = −γi。同时， 我们通过Pvector 的表达式看出PvectorW 0 = W 0 及PvectorW i = 程(3.132)所述。\n\n−W i。此处两负号相互抵消，于是拉氏量中的这一项，在宇称变 换下变为 (PspinorΨ)†γ0γµ(PvectorW µ)jPL(PspinorΨ) = ¯ΨγµσjW µ j PRΨ ̸= ¯ΨγµσjW µ j PLΨ (7.110) 7.5 轻子质量项 133 因此这一项不具有不变性，也就违反了宇称对称性。\n\n宇称破坏还有一个重要的推论。还记得，我们会把那些在变换 50 详见附录A 中的解释。\n\n下相互转变的东西50竖着放在一起，夹在两个括号之间。比如我们 讨论四维矢量，是因为它的分量在空间转动和推动下可以相互转 化。在这一节中，我们知道只有左手粒子参与弱相互作用，而描述 这一现象的正确拉氏量写作¯ΨγµσjW µ j PLΨ = ¯ΨLγµσjW µ j ΨL。从 物理上说，这一项表明组成左手旋量双重态的两个分量，即两个 自旋1/2 场(ψ1)L, (ψ2)L 可以通过弱作用相互转化。而右手场不 参与弱相互作用，因而(ψ1)R, (ψ2)R 无法相互转化。可见，我们 没有理由将两个右手分量写成双重态的形式。在数学上，这意味 着右手场构成SU(2) 单态，也就是说，它们在对称操作下将根据 SU(2) 群的一维表示变换。从3.6.3节的讨论中我们知道，这等于 说右手场实际上在变换下不变。最后我们加以总结：\n\n• 左手场构成SU(2) 双重态：ΨL = \u0012(ψ1)L (ψ2)L\n\n\u0013 ，因为它们都参 与弱相互作用，可以互相转化。它们根据SU(2) 群的二维表 示变换：\n\nΨL →Ψ′ L = ei⃗a ⃗σ 2 ΨL (7.111)\n\n• 右手场由SU(2) 单态描述：(ψ1)R，(ψ2)R，因为它们不参与 弱相互作用，因而不能相互转化。它们根据SU(2) 的一维表 示变换： (ψ1)R →(ψ1)′ R = e0(ψ1)R = (ψ1)R (ψ2)R →(ψ2)′ R = e0(ψ2)R = (ψ2)R (7.112) 下面我们将继续讨论如何在保持原有对称性的前提下，于拉 氏量中加入自旋1 2 粒子的质量项。\n\n7.5 Lepton Mass Terms 轻子质量项 在7.2节开头，我们发现无法既保证SU(2) 对称性，又在拉氏 量中加入任意的质量项¯ΨmΨ。在这一节里，我们会看到宇称破坏 让问题变得更加复杂。最后我们将再次引入希格斯机制解决这一 难题。\n\n在上一节中，我们讨论了耦合项¯ΨγµσjW µ j PLΨ 的手性。然 而质量项的手性又如何呢？回顾我们在方程(6.7)与(6.8)中导出的， 不含导数的旋量不变量： I1 := (χa)†ξ ˙a = (χL)†ξR 和I2 := (ξa)T χa = (ξR)†χL 51 如上节所述，狄拉克旋量ψL 和ψR 由手性投影算符定义： ψL = PLψ 和ψR = PRψ。注 意¯ψ = ψ†γ0 (7.113) 我们可以用狄拉克旋量将其写为51： 134 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论\n\n¯ψψ = ¯ψLψR + ¯ψRψL\n\n= \u0010 χ† L 0

不变量。如：\n\n→¯Ψ′ Lψ′ R = ¯ΨLe−ibi σi\n\n¯Ψ |{z} 双重态 ψR |{z} 单态 2 ψR ̸= ¯ΨLψR (7.115) 基于处理自旋1 场质量项的经验，我们重规叠矩，不加入上 述质量项，而是在拉氏量中加入与0 自旋场耦合，且满足SU(2) 不变的相互作用项。此后通过选择0 自旋场的真空期望值，破缺 这一对称性，进而制造出质量项。\n\n耦合0 自旋双重态与自旋1 2 场，且保证SU(2), U(1) 与洛伦 兹不变性的项，由下式给出：\n\n¯ΨLΦψR (7.116) 52 注意到ΦL → Φ′L = eibi(x)σiΦL，及σ† i = σi。\n\n为验证其不变性，我们将SU(2) 变换作用于上式52\n\n¯ΨLΦψR →¯Ψ′LΦψ′R = ¯ΨLe−ibi(x)σiΦeibi(x)σiψR = ¯ΨLΦψR ✓ 同时作用U(1) 变换\n\n¯ΨLΦψR →¯Ψ′LΦψ′R = ¯ΨLe−ia(x)Φeia(x)ψR = ¯ΨLΦψR ✓ 530 自旋场根据定义，应随洛伦 兹群的(0, 0) 表示变换。在这一 表示中，所有洛伦兹变换都是恒 等变换。在3.7.4中我们导出了这 一结论。\n\n0 自旋场（洛伦兹标量）在洛伦兹变换下不变53，于是这一项 为洛伦兹不变量，因为它的其余因子与方程(7.114)相同。\n\n这类相互作用项被称为Yukawa 耦合。我们将这一项与其厄 米共轭结合，再乘以耦合常数54−λ2，加入到拉氏量之中。\n\n54 稍后，我们会讨论包含ψR 1 和 −λ1 的相互作用项。届时，读者 就能明白为什么我们将耦合常数 记为−λ2，以及下式为何只包含 ψR 2 。\n\nL = −λ2(¯ΨLΦψR 2 + ¯ψR 2 ΦΨL) (7.117) 这一额外项不仅描述了fermion 与Higgs 场的耦合，也在 SU(2) 对称性破缺后导致了fermion 质量项的产生。我们在真空 期望附近展开，选择方程(7.77) r\n\n\u0012 0 v + h\n\n\u0013 1 2\n\nΦ = 将其代入拉氏量，得到\n\n\u0012\u0000¯ΨL 1 , ¯ΨL 2 \u0001 \u0012 0 v +

获得了质量项。那么第一个场ψ1 怎么办呢？\n\n553.7.10节探讨了电荷共轭的概 念。\n\n为了获得Ψ1 的质量项，我们考虑电荷共轭55Higgs 场˜Ψ = ϵΨ∗ 的耦合项。由于 0 v+h √\n\n!\n\n\u0013 0 v+h √\n\n!\n\nv+h √\n\n!\n\n→˜Φ = ϵΦ∗= \u0012 0 1 −1 0 2 0\n\n=\n\nΦ = 2 2

与τ, ντ 也有等价的写法。这一写法是由实验 结果所确定的，因为在弱相互作用下，电子要么转化为动量可能 不同的另一电子，要么变为电子中微子νe 与其它粒子的集合。在 弱相互作用中，e 和νe（同样包括µ, νµ 与τ, ντ）总是相伴出现。 这一事实可以用耦合项¯ΨγµσjW µ j PLΨ 的数学形式加以解释。如 57 这再次给出 σiW µ i = \u0012 W µ 3 W µ 1

= mlh cl = λlh √ 2h √ v (7.125) 2 = |{z} 方程(7.124) 从这一方程可以看出，Higgs 场与给定轻子的耦合强度，正比 于这一轻子的质量。轻子质量越大，耦合强度越强。运用类似的推 导，我们可将这一结论推广到所有粒子。\n\n参与弱相互作用的自旋1 2 粒子还包括夸克。同时，夸克还参 与第三种相互作用：强相互作用。这一内容将在7.8节中讨论。首 先我们将讨论夸克的质量项，可喜的是，这一主题可用类似引入 轻子质量的方法加以处理。\n\n7.6 夸克质量项 137 7.6 Quark Mass Terms 夸克质量项 在上一节中我们知道，SU(2) 双重态包含了两种可通过弱作 用力相互转化的粒子。就夸克58而言，这两种粒子是上夸克和下夸 克。\n\n\u0013 q = \u0012u d (7.126) 类似的，奇夸克、粲夸克，和顶夸克、底夸克也各自组成双重态。\n\n与前文一样，考虑到只有左手粒子参与弱相互作用的实验事 实，我们构造左手双重态和右手单态：\n\n= \u0012uL dL\n\n\u0013 → eiai σi 2 qL (7.127) qL |{z} 双重态\n\n→ uR uR |{z} 单态\n\n→ dR (7.128) dR |{z} 单态 右手粒子依旧不参与弱相互作用，不能转化为任何其它粒子， 只构成SU(2) 单态（单分量的数学对象）。\n\n这里，我们遇到了与处理轻子质量时相同的疑难：为了得到洛 伦兹不变量，我们需要组合左、右手旋量。然而，这样的组合却不 满足SU(2) 不变性，这让我们转而选择引入Higgs 机制。换而言 之，我们放弃在拉氏量中直接加入质量项：\n\n¯qLuR + ¯qLdR + ¯uRqL + ¯dRqL (7.129) 因为它不满足SU(2) 不变性。相反，我们考虑夸克与0 自旋 场Ψ 的耦合项：\n\nλu¯qL ˜ΦuR + λd¯qLΦdR + λu¯uR ˜ΦqL + λd ¯dRΦqL (7.130) 59 即 方 程(7.120)， 这里我们引入耦合常数λu, λd 和电荷共轭Higgs 双重态59，后者 v+h √\n\n!\n\n˜Φ = ϵΦ∗= |{z} =

Isospin 同位旋 61Φ =\n\n，电荷共轭 2 Higgs 场有类似结论。\n\n现在讨论SU(2) 对称性所对应的守恒量。自由拉氏量只具有 全局对称性，而加入相互作用项，则为其引入了局域对称性。注意 138 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 到全局对称性是局域对称性的特例，因此全局对称性也存在于所 有局域对称的拉氏量之中，其对应的守恒量也在两种情况下都守 恒。由于Noether 定理，SU(2) 对称性给出了一个新的守恒量：同 位旋。同位旋与电荷类似，后者对应全局U(1) 对称性。 将Noether 定理应用于内部对称性（见4.5.5节，参考方程(4.56)） 得到， Z d3x ∂L ∂(∂0Ψ)δΨ | {z } =Q\n\n= 0 (7.131)\n\n∂0 拉氏量在下述形式的变换下不变： 2 Ψ = (1 + iai σi\n\nΨ →eiai σi 2 + . . .)Ψ (7.132) 于是无穷小变分写为δΨ = iai σi 2 Ψ，其中ai 为任意系数。可见每 个生成元都对应了一个守恒量，因为取ai 中任意两个为0、第三 个不为0 时，拉氏量同样具有不变性。比如a2 = a3 = 0 而a1 ̸= 0， 或a1 = a2 = 0 而a3 ̸= 0。当然，取a1 ̸= 0, a2 ̸= 0 且a3 ̸= 0 时 我们还能得到一个守恒量，但它其实是上述与生成元对应的三个 守恒量之和。换而言之，一共有三个独立的守恒量，它们与SU(2) 生成元一一对应。\n\n全局不变的自由拉氏量写为（方程(7.45)）： LD1+D2 = i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ 对应守恒量为Qi。举例来说，对电子—中微子双重态，我们 有62 62 见方程(7.131)，与往常一样， 定义中不含任意常数ai。\n\nQi = i¯Ψγ0 σi 2 Ψ\n\n= \u0012νe e\n\n\u0013† γ0γ0 |{z} =1\n\n\u0012νe e\n\n\u0013\n\nσi (7.133) 2 注意Pauli 矩阵中只有σ3 是对角矩阵。因此对双重态(νe, e) 的两 个分量来说，只有i = 3 的守恒量才有确定的取值。而分量νe 与 e 不是另两个生成元σ1 和σ2 的本征态。当然，可以自由选取基矢 以保证如σ2 处于对角形式。这样一来，我们可以重新定义νe 和 e，最终结果也并无不同。这里的重点在于，尽管存在三个与生成 元一一对应的守恒量，但每一时刻却只能用其中一个来标记粒子 或量子态。\n\n对i = 3 我们有 Q3 = \u0012νe e\n\n\u0013† σ3\n\n\u0012νe e\n\n\u0013 2\n\n\u0012νe e\n\n\u0013† \u00121 0 0

2\n\n\u0012νe e\n\n\u0013† \u00120 1 1 0\n\n\u0013 \u0012νe e\n\n\u0013\n\n= 1 2\n\n= 1 2ν† ee −1 2e†νe (7.135) 矩阵σ1 不是对角阵，也就无法用来标记粒子。\n\n7.7.1 Labelling States 标记量子态 在3.5节中，我们介绍了Cartan 生成元的概念，它们是给定群 的对角生成元。从上一节中我们知道，在为双重态中的粒子新增标 记时，这些生成元十分有用。63典型的SU(2) 双重态有以下形式 \u0012νe e 63 在后续章节中，我们将以同样 的方法处理三重态，及SU(3) 不 变性对应的守恒量。\n\n\u0013 (7.136) SU(2) 只有一个Cartan 生成元J3 = 1 2σ3，它的本征值为+1 2 和 2。（左手）中微子 \u0012νe 0\n\n\u0013 是这一生成元的本征态，具有本征值\n\n−1\n\n−1 2。这些本征值构成了粒子的新标记，亦即中微子和电子的同位 旋。\n\n按照同样的方法，我们可以用同位旋标记右手单重态。这些态 随SU(2) 的一维表示变换。一维表示的生成元就是064：Ji = 0。 因此这些单态正是Cartan 生成元J3 本征值为0 的本征态。总之， 643.7.4节解释了右手单重态不 参与变换的原因。\n\n右手单重态，如eR，具有0 同位旋。这与前文中右手场不参与弱 相互作用的事实前后呼应。正如不带电的对象不参与电磁相互作 用，不带同位旋的场也不参与弱相互作用。 最后，我们为规范场W µ +, W µ −, W µ 3 赋予同位旋，它们构成 SU(2) 三重态：\n\n\n\n\n\n W µ + W µ − W µ 3 W µ =\n\n (7.137) 随SU(2) 的三维表示变换。此时，Cartan 生成元J3 有三个本征值：\n\n+1, −1, 065，于是我们得出Q3(W µ +) = 1, Q3(W µ −) = −1, Q3(W µ 3 ) = 65 这可由方程(3.121)中 J3 的矩阵形式直接导出：J3 =  0。这便是W+ 与W−玻色子的同位旋。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n W µ 1 W µ 2 W µ 3\n\n 1 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0\n\n。\n\n对应另一组基矢，其中J3 不是对角 应注意，三重态 阵。这是引入W µ ± 的另一个原因。\n\n140 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 为了进一步阐明个中联系，我们回顾引入规范场W µ i 的过 程。在拉氏量中，这三个规范场与群的生成元相组合，以σiW µ i 的形式出现。这可以看做对象W µ 以σi 为基的线性展开：W µ =\n\nσiW µ i = σ3W µ 3 +σ2W µ 2 +σ3W µ 3 ，如同矢量展开为基矢量的线性组 合：⃗v = v1⃗e1 + v2⃗e2 + v3⃗e3。由于生成元是SU(2) Lie 代数中的元 素66，W µ 也应是同一Lie 代数中的元素。因此，W µ 的变换规律 66 李代数构成向量空间！\n\n将由SU(2) 在自身Lie 代数上的表示所确定。也就是由SU(2) 的 元素如何作用于自身Lie 代数中的元素（生成元）所确定。这一观 念看似奇特，实则自然而然。请读者回忆群表示的定义：群表示， 是从群到某一线性空间中所有线性算符集合的映射，这些线性算 67 准确的说，我们要求映射是同 态映射，应满足一些限制条件。\n\n符也构成线性空间67。目前为止，我们只关注了“外在”的线性空 间，如Minkowski 空间。而与群相关的唯一68内生线性空间却正 68 群本身不是向量空间。我们 可以研究群如何作用于自身，但 这不是群表示，而是群的具体化 （realization）。\n\n是群的李代数！由此可见，研究群在这一线性空间上的表示并不 奇怪。这一具有特别重要性的群表示，被称为群的伴随表示。\n\n规范场（如W+, W−, W3）是规范群伴随表示中的元素。SU(2) Lie 代数是三维的，因为它由三个生成元生成，并具有三维的伴随 表示。正如矢量的分量自上而下写在左右括号之间69，我们也可以\n\n\n\n\n\n v1 v2 v3 69⃗v =\n\n 将W µ 的三个分量自上而下写在括号之间70，并称之为三重态。这\n\n\n\n\n\n W µ 1 W µ 2 W µ 3 些伴随表示下的生成元，可以通过基矢变换与前面导出的三维生 成元相联系。\n\n70W µ =\n\n 在下一节中，我们将讨论“更高阶”的内部对称群SU(3)。我 们将看到，要求拉氏量满足局域SU(3) 不变性，可以导出描述强 相互作用的拉氏量。\n\n7.8 SU(3)Interactions SU(3) 相互作用 和上一节中在两个fermion 场和SU(2) 中干的一样，我们可 以在三个fermion 场中找到一个局域SU(3) 不变的拉格朗日量。\n\n这个对称性不会破缺，对应于自旋为1 的无质量胶子场。SU(3) 是 由全体行列式为1 的3 × 3 幺正矩阵构成的群，即 U†U = UU† = I det{U} = 1。 (7.138) 71 在2.4中已经提到了，大写罗 马字母A, B, . . . 总是要从1 到 8 求和。\n\n如通常处理Lie 群时一样，我们能将其写成指数函数71 U = eiTAθA。 (7.139) 72 见(3.80)式以及其后的文字， 其基底由2 × 2 Pauli 矩阵给出。\n\n同SU(2) 的情形一样72，该群的定义式(7.138)要求其生成元是厄 米且无迹的。\n\nT † A = TA (7.140) Tr (TA) = 0 (7.141) 73 一般的，SU(N) 群有N2 −1 个生成元。生成元的数目常被称 为群的秩(rank)。\n\n一组这样的无迹厄米的基底，至少在一种表象下，由如下八个733× 7.8 SU(3) 相互作用 141 3 个矩阵给出，称为Gell-Mann 矩阵：\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 0 −i 0 i 0 0 0 0 0\n\n 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n 1 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0\n\n λ2 =\n\n λ3 =\n\n\n\nλ1

这里仍约定诸如A, B, C 的大写字母取遍1 到8 的全部值。fABC 称为SU(3) 群的结构常数，对于SU(2) 群它就是Levi-Civita 符 号ϵijk。这些系数可以直接暴力算出75 75 这个结果不是很优美，但为了 完整性我们还是将其列出 f123 = 1 (7.144) f147 = −f156 = f246 = f257 = f345 = −f367 = 1 2 (7.145)\n\n√ 3 2 ， (7.146) f458 = f678 = 剩下的都可以根据结构常数fABC 对于指标是交换反对称的这一 性质算出。例如 fABC = −fBAC = −fCBA。 (7.147) 还剩下一些不能通过重新给指标排序得到的项都是零。\n\n类似于我们在7.2节中对SU(2) 干过的事，引入自旋1 2 场的三 重态\n\n\n\n\n\n q1 q2 q3\n\n (7.148) Q = 同SU(2) 的情形一样，我们给三重态中的对象赋予了新的指标， 在下一小节中会仔细讨论。\n\n为了使拉格朗日量 L = i ¯Q∂µγµQ −¯QmQ (7.149) 142 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 局域SU(3) 不变要求添加自旋1 2 场和新的自旋1 场的耦合项。推 导类似于SU(2) 的情形，但具体计算会更加麻烦，所以我们仅给 出最后的拉格朗日量76 L = −1 4F A αβF αβ A + ¯Q(iDµγµ −m)Q， (7.150) 自旋1 胶子场GA α 的场强张量F A αβ 定义为 F A αβ = ∂αGA β −∂βGA α −gfABCGB α GC β (7.151) 其中fABC 为前面在生成元的对易子中出现过的SU(3) 群的结构 常数。此外，Dα 定义为 Dα = ∂α + igT CGC α (7.152) 其中TC 是此节一开始定义的SU(3) 群的生成元。可以看到，除 了生成元和对易关系有一点区别，这里每一项都完全和SU(2) 的 情形相类似。\n\n7.8.1 Color 色 类似于7.7节中对SU(2) 的讨论，我们可以通过Noether 定理 从SU(3) 对称性中得到新的守恒量。完全相同的思路，这里我们 有8 个守恒量，每个生成元对应一个。同样也只能使用对角生成 元的守恒量来标记粒子。SU(3) 群有两个Cartan 77生成元1 77 回忆，Cartan 生成元= 对角 生成元。\n\n2λ3 和 1 2λ8。是故，每个通过强作用力相互作用的粒子携带两个额外的指 标，对应于这两个Cartan 生成元的本征值。\n\n\n\n\n\n 1 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0\n\n的本征值78是+1 1 2λ3 = 1 2、−1 2

类似的\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0013 给\n\n\u0012 −1\n\n 0 1 0 2, 1 2 √\n\nψ 3 并定义蓝色(blue):= \u0010 −1\n\n\u0011 。 将这些东西称作颜色的想法来自于如下事实：如果将三种色加在\n\n\u0011 ，同样的绿色(green):= \u0010 0, −1 √ 2, 1 2 √ 3 3 一起，即 \n\n\n\n 1 1 1\n\nψ， 我们便得到一个零荷的态（无色态），因为\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1 1 1\n\n 1 1 1\n\n= 0 以及 λ8\n\n= 0，\n\nλ3 就像包含了所有颜色光的日光却是无色的一样。\n\n完全类似于我们在SU(2) 上干的，将全体SU(3) 单态的色荷 取做零，这样这些粒子间就不存在强相互作用了。细节上有点区别： 它们是无色的。另外，也能通过完全类似于7.7节中给W-Bosons 80 由于我们有8 个生成元，所以 说SU(3) 群的伴随表示是8 维 的。\n\n指定赝自旋的步骤，利用SU(3) 群的（8 维80）伴随表示来给规范 场Gµ A（胶子）来指定颜色。\n\n7.8.2 Quark Description 夸克描述 81 由自旋1 通过强力相互作用的自旋1 2 粒子81称为夸克。如果要对夸克 进行讨论，我们得考虑一大堆事情： 2 场产生，在第6章中 已经详细讨论\n\n• 夸克们是SU(3) 的三重态，用Q 表示。一个三重态里有不同\n\n\n\n\n\n ur ug ub\n\n。为了保证SU(3) 颜色的同类夸克，例如上夸克：U = 不变，三重态总是以¯QQ 的形式成对出现。我们也可以用指 标记号将其写作¯QQ = ¯qcqc，其中指标c 代表色c = r, g, b。 • 另外，夸克之间还有弱相互作用，所以也是SU(2) 的二重 82 每一个二重态里有两个不同 的夸克，例如一个上夸克和一个 下夸克，或者一个顶夸克和一个 底夸克。\n\n态。二重态82中的每一个元（= 每一个夸克）是一个三重态： q = \u0012uc dc\n\n\u0013 。这很是困扰人，所以说除非需要考虑强相互作用 力，色指标c 通常省略。 • 这还不够，要记得每一个夸克都由一个Dirac 旋量描述，这 又是一个二分量的对象uc = \u0012(χL u)c (ξR u )c\n\n\u0013 。上分量描述右手夸 克而下分量描述一个同样的左手夸克。\n\n说了这些，再回到SU(3) 相互作用上来。令人开心的是，全 部实验都表明SU(3) 的规范boson ，即胶子，是无质量的，故不 144 Chapter 7. 相互作用理论 需要给拉格朗日量添加一项规范boson 的质量项。那么SU(3) 就 不需要破缺。\n\n除此之外，fermion 的质量项在SU(3) 对称性下也不是问题， 因为如下形式的项\n\n¯QmQ (7.153) 当三重态中的全部粒子都是等质量时是SU(3) 不变的。即m 正比\n\n\n\n\n\n 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 于单位阵83。三重态中的东西描述了处于不同颜色的同样的夸克， 应当有着相同的质量。例如，对于一个上夸克，其三重态为 83m = m\n\n而不是\n\n\n\n\n\n m1 0 0 0 m2 0 0 0 m3\n\n\n\n\n\n m =\n\n ur ub ug\n\n， (7.154) U = 其中ur、ub、ug 分别代表一个红色、蓝色和绿色的上夸克，都有 着相同的质量。\n\n其他的自旋1 2 粒子，像是电子和中微子，不携带色，故不能 与胶子相耦合。由于其耦合常数比电磁相互作用(U(1)) 和弱相互 作用(SU(2)) 大得多，从局域SU(3) 不变性导出的相互作用称为 强相互作用(strong interaction)。\n\n7.9 The Interplay Between Fermions and Bosons Bosons 和 Fermions 间的游戏 在这一节我们将使用更加物理的语言，对本章得到的所有内 容作一个总结。我们之后将学到自旋1 2 场能产生/湮灭自旋1 2 粒 子，自旋1 的场也能产生和湮灭自旋1 的粒子。这一章中我们导 出用于描述不同的场以及对应的粒子相互作用的拉格朗日量。\n\n在1.3节中就已经提到，我们称自旋1 2 粒子为fermion ，自旋 为1 粒子为boson 。标准的说法是fermion 构成了物质而boson 作为物质间相互作用的媒介。现在我们能搞明白这句话说的是什 么了。\n\n这一章从第6章得到的自由场的拉格朗日量出发，发现了单个、 两个、或三个自由的自旋1 2 场的拉格朗日量的内禀对称性；这些 都只是全局对称性，由于狭义相对论的约束看上去相当不可信；而 局域对称性则显得更加自然。\n\n接着，我们发现能通过添加耦合项来保持拉格朗日量局域不 变。这些耦合项描述了原有的自旋1 2 场和新的自旋为1 的场的相 互作用。由于一些历史上的原因，这里的内禀对称性被称为规范 对称性，相应的自旋为1 的场也称为规范场。通过Noether 定理， 我们能从每一个内禀对称性得到一个新的守恒量。类似于从U(1) 对称性中得到的电荷，它们被诠释为荷。\n\n7.9 Bosons 和Fermions 间的游戏 145\n\n• 为了得到一个局域U(1) 不变的拉格朗日量，我们需要一个 规范场Aµ。最终的拉格朗日量正确的描述了电磁相互作用。 U(1) 对称性告诉我们电荷是守恒的。\n\n• 为了得到一个局域SU(2) 不变的拉格朗日量，我们需要三个 规范场W µ 1 , W µ 2 , W µ 3 。最终的拉格朗日量正确的描述了弱相 互作用。SU(2) 对称性告诉我们同位旋是守恒的。\n\n• 为了得到一个局域SU(3) 不变的拉格朗日量，我们需要八个 规范场Gµ 1, Gµ 2, . . . 最终的拉格朗日量正确的描述了强相互 作用。SU(3) 对称性告诉我们色是守恒的。 不同种类的力由不同的boson (自旋为1 的粒子) 负责。电磁 力的媒介是光子，由U(1) 规范场Aµ 产生。弱力的媒介是W +、 W −和Z boson ，而强力是8 个不同的胶子，分别由相应的SU(2) 和SU(3) 规范场产生。\n\n此外，我们发现SU(2) 对称性禁止拉格朗日量中的质量项。 而从实验中我们得知这是不对的。在不破坏任何对称性的前提先 添加质量项的解决方案是Higgs 机制。它通过添加描述已有的自 旋为1 场、自旋1 2 场与一个新的零自旋场（Higgs 场）的相互作 用来实现。通过SU(2) 对称性的自发破缺，并将Higgs 场在一个 新的非对称极小点处展开，我们能得到拉格朗日量中所需要的质 量项。\n\nIV Applications

Quantum Mechanics 量子力学 Summary 总结 本章讲述量子力学，基于第5章讲过的对应关系1，由此首先可 导出相对论性能量-动量关系。\n\n在建立量子力学的基本框架后，我们就对Klein-Gordon 方程 （最简单的标量型粒子的运动方程）取非相对论极限，得到著名的 Schrödinger 方程，方程的解被诠释为概率幅，随后我们用波动 力学的方法分析两个简单例子。\n\n之后呢，我们引入了Dirac 符号，这对于理解量子力学的结 构十分有帮助。系统的初始态被一个抽象的态矢量|i⟩标记，称之 为右矢。测量该初始态得到某一特定末状态的概率幅可以用左矢 （记作⟨f|，表示末态）乘以右矢|i⟩计算。左矢与右矢的乘积⟨f|i⟩ 是一个复数，即为状态i →f 的概率幅，发生这个过程的概率就 是|A|2。之后讨论投影算符。我们会看到它是如何与完备性关系一 起用来把任意状态用任意一个算符的本征态来进行展开的。之前 常用的波动力学方法可以视为将态矢在坐标基底展开的特例。在 Dirac 符号下，Schrödinger 方程用于计算态的时间演化。为了阐 明这一联系，我们会用Dirac 符号来重新讨论一个前面用波动力 学求解过的例子。\n\n8.1 Particle Theory

相对论性能量动量关系 第6.2节推导了自旋0 自由场的运动方程——Klein-Gordon 方 程： (∂µ∂µ + m2)Φ = 0, 利用上一节的那些对应关系3，\n\n\n\n p0 p1 p2 p3\n\n  = \u0012p0 ⃗p\n\n\u0013 = \u0012E ⃗p\n\n\u0013\n\n   (∂µ∂µ + m2)Φ = (∂0∂0 −∂i∂i +

(8.2) 这就是著名的狭义相对论能量-动量关系(energy-momentum relation)。上式应用于静止粒子(⃗p = 0) 即得到Einstein 著名的 质能方程： E2 = m2 →E = mc2 其中为了明确起见我们把c2 写了回来。现在就理解了Poincaré 群 的第一个Casimir 算符pµpµ 的标量值（见(3.258)式）为何要用m2 这样的符号来标记了。pµpµ 就代表着粒子质量的平方，而通过实 验，比如说测量粒子的能量和动量，就可测量质量m = p E2 −⃗p 2。 同理，我们也可以理解为什么6.2节要把拉格朗日量里面的系数常 数记作m2。\n\n8.3 The Quantum Formalism 量子力学的数学形式 前面说过，物理量用算符表示，这些算符作用于什么对象？首 先需要注意每个算符都有一组本征函数，就像矩阵的本征向量一 8.3 量子力学的数学形式 151 样。矩阵是有限维的，因此矩阵有有限多个本征向量；而算符通常 作用在无限维的矢量空间中，而得到无穷多个本征函数。比如，动 量算符的本征函数满足的本征方程为 本征函数 z}|{ Ψ (8.3)\n\n−i∂i |{z} 算符\n\nΨ = pi |{z} 本征值 其中，pi 是一个数。一个显然的解为 C |{z} =常数 eipixi\n\n→−i∂iCeipixi = piCeipixi ✓ (8.4) 但要注意，对于任意的pi，这都是一个解。因此我们发现有无穷 多个动量算符ˆpi = −i∂i 的本征函数。能量本征函数也能用同样的 办法来得到 i∂0Φ = EΦ (8.5) 4 角动量本征函数的求解更加复 杂，因为角动量算符比其它算符 本身就更复杂。我们找不到一组 三个角动量分量共同的本征态， 因为[ˆLi, ˆLj] ̸= 0。这在后面就 会详细讨论，最终选取的本征函 数是角动量第三个方向ˆL3（和角 动量算符的平方ˆL2，它与其它的 角动量分量都对易[ˆL2, ˆLj] = 0） 的完备归一基，即著名的球谐函 数基。\n\n角动量的本征函数也是一样4。类比于矩阵的本征矢量，这些本征 函数可以看做基5，而这就意味着我们可以把任意的函数Ψ 按照这 些基进行展开。例如，在动量本征函数6进行展开（简明起见，考 虑一维情形） Z ∞\n\nΨ = 1 √\n\n−∞ dpΨpe−ipx (8.6) 2π 其中，Ψp 是展开系数，类似于矢量⃗v = v1⃗e1 + v2⃗e2 + v3⃗e3 中的 5 在矩阵中，本征矢量是矩阵对 应的矢量空间的基 v1, v2, v3。对于一些系统来说，我们的边界条件使得最后得到的基 是离散而不连续的。我们可以，比如说，用能量本征态ΦEc 进行 6 注意，这其实就是我们在附 录D.1中介绍的Fourier 变换，因 子 1 √ 展开： 2π 是出于习惯约定。\n\nΨ = X n cnΦEn (8.7) 注意，一般来说，一个算符的本征函数并不是另一个算符的本征 函数。只有当两个算符对易，即[A, B] = AB −BA = 0 时，才 可以找到一组同时是两个算符本征函数的基。下面证明这个命题。 设[C, D] ̸= 0 →CD ̸= DC，而对于C 的某个本征函数Ψ，有 CΨ = cΨ，其中c 是它的本征值。如果Ψ 同时也是D 的本征函 数DΨ = dΨ，则有 CDΨ = CdΨ = |{z} 因为d 只是一个数 dCΨ = dcΨ DCΨ = DcΨ = cDΨ = cdΨ = |{z} 因为数之间互相对易 dcΨ 152 Chapter 8. 量子力学\n\n→DC = CD 这与[C, D] ̸= 0 矛盾，因而不存在共同的本征函数。\n\n(8.8) 一般来说，物理量算符作用在描述物理系统的态(state)7Ψ 上，通过求解运动方程得到Ψ。\n\n一般的解按照某组基展开都会超过一项。举个例子，考虑两个 8 这意味着所有的展开系数Ψ = P n cnΦEn 是零。\n\n能量本征态2Ψ = c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2 8，能量算符作用于它可得\n\nˆEΨ = ˆE(c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2) = c1E1ΦE1 + c2E2ΦE2 ̸= E(c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2) (8.9) 由此可见不同能量（的能量本征态）叠加(superposition) 形成 的态一般不是能量算符的本征态，因为本征态需要满足定义—— 存在某个数E 使得ˆEΨ = EΨ。不过，处于Ψ 状态系统的能量是 多少呢？两个能量本征态的叠加态又意味着什么呢？它的物理意 义是什么？\n\n9 如果假定Ψ 直接描述粒子，那 么它的U(1) 变换Ψ′ = eiαΨ （也是运动方程的解）描述的是什 么呢？\n\n首先我们能从拉格朗日量的U(1) 对称性中得到一点提示，它 表明从Ψ 的运动方程得到的解没有直接的物理意义9。\n\n另一方面，注意到运动方程所有的解都是⃗x, t 的函数10，即 Ψ = Ψ(⃗x, t)。\n\n10 下一节会对这点详细说明。\n\n标准诠释是，波函数Ψ(⃗x, t) 的模方|Ψ(⃗x, t)|2 表示粒子位置 的概率密度。注意U(1) 变换对于|Ψ|2 = Ψ†Ψ →(Ψ′)†(Ψ′) = Ψ†e−iαeiαΨ = Ψ†Ψ 这样的量是没有影响的。换句话说（以一维情 形为例），Ψ(x, t) 是在[x, x + dx] 区间内测量到粒子的概率密度3。\n\n因此，如果对整个空间积分的话，必定有 Z dxΨ∗(x, t)Ψ(x, t) != 1 (8.10) 这称为波函数的归一化，因为在全空间中找到一个粒子的概率必 定为100% = 1。\n\n如果要预言其他物理量，则必须把波函数用相应的本征函数 基展开。比如说用能量本征基展开：Ψ = c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2 + · · · 。标 准的量子力学诠释是，测量Ψ 状态的体系的能量，所得结果只能 为能量本征值，测量结果为本征值E1 的概率为Ψ 与能量本征函 数ΦE1 的“交叠”（的绝对值平方）： Z dxΦ∗ E1(x, t)Ψ(x, t) P(E1) = 2 2即能量算符（哈密顿算符）ˆH 的本征态，能量本征值为E 的本征态记作ΦE. 3即在区间[x, x + dx] 测量到粒子的概率为|Ψ(x, t)|2dx. 8.3 量子力学的数学形式 153 在上面的例子中，它就是 P(E1) = Z dxΦ∗ E1(x, t)Ψ(x, t) 2 = Z dxΦ∗ E1(x, t)(c1ΦE1 + c2ΦE2 + · · · ) 2 2 Z dxΦ∗ E1(x, t)ΦE1 | {z } =1 如之前所讲\n\n+ Z dxΦ∗ E1(x, t)(c2ΦE2 + · · · ) | {z } =0 因为本征态是正交的 c1\n\n=\n\n= |c1|2 (8.11) 类似的，可以将Ψ(⃗x, t) 用动量本征函数展开： Z ∞\n\nΨ(⃗x, t) = 1 √\n\n−∞ d3pΨ(⃗p, t)e−i⃗p·⃗x, 2π 则Ψ(⃗p, t) 是系统动量处于[p, p + dp] 区间内的概率幅。 这种解释可以用来对系统做几率性预测，比如用下一节介绍 的统计期望值的办法。之后我们会导出非相对论性量子力学的运 动方程，并看两个例子。\n\n8.3.1 Expectation Value 期望值 统计学中，期望值是类比于加权平均定义的。比如，如果掷骰 子十次得到的结果为2, 4, 1, 3, 3, 6, 3, 1, 4, 5，那么它的平均值就是\n\n⟨x⟩= (2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 5) · 1 10 = 3.2 而另一种计算这个的方法是先将相同结果放在一起，通过权重给 出平均值\n\n⟨x⟩= 2 10 · 1 + 1 10 · 2 + 3 10 · 3 + 2 10 · 4 + 1 10 · 5 + 1 10 · 6 = 3.2 一般的，我们可以写\n\n⟨x⟩= X i ρixi (8.12) 其中ρi 表示几率。对一个连续分布的情况同样有\n\n⟨x⟩= Z dxρ(x)x (8.13) 类比上面的形式，在量子力学中物理量ˆO 期望值的定义为\n\n⟨ˆO⟩= Z d3xΨ∗ˆOΨ (8.14) 一般的，要把Ψ 按照ˆO 的本征函数展开，比如说动量本征函数。 然后，把算符ˆO 作用在这些态上，得到对应的本征值，这样就得 到了加权和。\n\n154 Chapter 8. 量子力学 举个例子，处于Ψ 态的粒子的坐标期望值为\n\n⟨ˆx⟩= Z d3xΨ∗ˆxΨ = Z d3xΨ∗xΨ = Z d3x x Ψ∗Ψ |{z} 在位置x的几率密度 (8.15) 为了计算方便，下面取Klein-Gordon 方程的非相对论极限。\n\n8.4 Schrödinger Equation Schrödinger 方程 Klein-Gordon 方程有平面波解\n\nΦ = e±ipµxµ ≡e±ip·x 其中，pµ = (E, ⃗p)T ，是粒子四动量（满足守恒律）： 0 = (∂µ∂µ + m2)Φ\n\n= (∂µ∂µ + m2)e±ipµxµ\n\n= (i2pµpµ + m2)e±ipµxµ = 0\n\n= (−m2 + m2)e±ipµxµ = 0 ✓ (8.16) 我们可以把解写成稍不同的形式\n\nΦ = e±ipµxµ = Φ = ei(−Et+⃗x·⃗p)\n\nΦ 的时间部分是e−iEt，即Φ ∝e−iEt。从(8.2)式可知 s r m2 \u0012 ⃗p2 m2 + 1 \u0013 = m E = p\n\n⃗p2\n\n⃗p2 + m2 = m2 + 1. 在非相对论极限|⃗p| ≪m 下，即研究对象的移动速度比光速要慢 很多，从而其动量比质量也要小很多的情形下，可以对能量进行 Taylor 展开： m2 + · · · \u0013 E = m \u0012 1 + 1 2 ⃗p2\n\n→E ≈m |{z} 静质量 + ⃗p2\n\n. 2m |{z} 动能 于是\n\nΦ = ei(−Et+⃗x·⃗p) ≈e−imt ei⃗p·⃗x−i(p2/2m)t | {z } ≡ϕ(⃗x,t) = e−imtϕ(⃗x, t) (8.17) 由|⃗p| ≪m 可知静质能远大于粒子动能，因此ϕ(⃗x, t) 的振动 频率远低于e−imt. 把e−imtϕ(⃗x, t) 作为试探解4带入Klein-Gordon 方程可得5 (∂µ∂µ + m2)e−imtϕ(⃗x, t) = (∂0∂0 −∂i∂i + m2)e−imtϕ(⃗x, t) = 0. 4译者注：ansatz

∂i∂i + m2\u0001 ϕ(⃗x, t) = 0, 两边可以除掉e−imt，因为它肯定不是零。因此，\n\n→ \u0000 (−im + ∂t)2 + ∇2 + m2\u0001 ϕ(⃗x, t) = 0 (8.18) 7 → \u0000 −m2 −2im∂t + (∂t)2 + ∇2 + m2\u0001 ϕ(⃗x, t) = 0. 把第三项 (∂t)2ϕ(⃗x, t) =

(8.22) 此即为非相对论性能量—动量关系。 从该式出发很容易考虑粒子位于外势场V 中的情况，因为外 势场中粒子的能量就是动能加势能：\n\n→E = ⃗p2 2m + V. 6原文下式有误，译文已按勘误表修改 7原文下式有误，译文已按勘误表修改 156 Chapter 8. 量子力学 典型的例子有谐振子势V = −kx2.

(8.37) 复数c 即为|Ψ⟩状态的粒子观测位于|Φ⟩状态的概率幅，即相应 的概率为|⟨Φ||Ψ⟩|2. 例如测量一个|Ψ⟩状态的粒子位于[x, x + dx] 的概率为\n\n⟨x||Ψ⟩≡Ψ(x).\n\nΨ(x) 即为前面使用的波函数。再比如，观测粒子的动量位于[p, p+ dp] 的概率幅是多少？答案用Dirac 符号表示为\n\n⟨p||Ψ⟩≡Ψ(p). 20 粒子在全空间中出现的的概 率为100% = 1，或等价地说， 粒子的动量取任意值的概率为 100% = 1. 换句话说，所有状 态的概率之和等于1. 我们一直采用的是概率性诠释，因而物理状态必须是归一化的20， 例如 Z dx |Ψ(x, t)|2 = Z dxΨ†(x, t)Ψ(x, t) != 1 (8.38) Z dp |Φ(p, t)|2 = Z dp Φ†(p, t)Φ(p, t) != 1. (8.39) 8.5 从波动方程到粒子的运动 161 上两式用Dirac 符号表示为 Z dx |⟨x||Ψ⟩|2 = Z dx \u0000 ⟨x||Ψ⟩ \u0001†⟨x||Ψ⟩= Z dx ⟨Ψ||x⟩⟨x||Ψ⟩!= 1 (8.40) Z dp |⟨p||Φ⟩|2 = Z dp \u0000 ⟨p||Φ⟩ \u0001†⟨p||Φ⟩= Z dp ⟨Φ||p⟩⟨p||Φ⟩!= 1. (8.41) 上面出现了一种新算符：|p⟩⟨p| 与|x⟩⟨x|，这种形式的算符称为投 影算符(projection operators)21。它们是算符，因为它们作用 21 就像前面介绍过的左手旋量、 右手旋量的投影算符那样，这些 投影算符也满足条件P 2 = P. 于右矢，得到新的右矢。例如\n\n|x⟩⟨x||Ψ⟩ | {z } 等于某个复数，记作Ψ(x)\n\n= |x⟩Ψ(x), 等号右侧是复数乘以右矢，因而作用结果是一个右矢，而算符就 是作用于右矢得到右矢的东西。由(8.40)式可以引入一个新算符： Z dx ⟨Ψ||x⟩⟨x||Ψ⟩=\n\nΨ \u0012Z dx |x⟩⟨x| \u0013\n\n|Ψ⟩= ⟨Ψ|ˆI|Ψ⟩!= 1. (8.42)\n\n| {z } ≡ˆI 由此可得\n\nˆI|Ψ⟩!= |Ψ⟩. (8.43) 任何表示物理状态的|Ψ⟩都满足⟨Ψ||Ψ⟩= 1，因为观测一个处 于|Ψ⟩状态的系统，所得结果为|Ψ⟩的概率为100% = 1. 例如， 在x0 处放置一个粒子，即在x0 处观测到该粒子的概率为1，则\n\n⟨x0||x0⟩= 1. ˆI 由此称为单位算符，它的地位就像数字1 在数字 乘法中那样。关系式 Z dx |x⟩⟨x| = ˆI, (8.44) 或者当基矢为离散的情况下 X i |i⟩⟨i| = ˆI (8.45) 称为完备性关系(completeness relations)。一般的右矢|a⟩在 基{|i⟩} 下的分量为\n\n|i⟩†|a⟩≡⟨i||a⟩≡ai, 分量ai 是复数。利用完备性关系，即P i |i⟩⟨i| = ˆI 可得\n\n|a⟩= X i |i⟩⟨i||a⟩= X i |i⟩ai. 162 Chapter 8. 量子力学 这可以看做是|a⟩在基{|i⟩} 下的展开式22，ai 可以视为展开系数。\n\n对于连续基，展开式写为\n\n|Ψ⟩= Z dx |x⟩⟨x||Ψ⟩ | {z } ≡Ψ(x),复数\n\n= Z dx |x⟩Ψ(x). 8.3.1节介绍的期望值用Dirac 符号表示为 23 见4.5.4节。\n\n⟨ˆO⟩= ⟨Ψ| ˆO|Ψ⟩. 下面重新回顾一下硬盒中的粒子，用Dirac 符号表述。\n\n2 4 N 5 S 1 8.5.4 Example: Particle in a Box, Again 例：盒子中的粒子，续 3 考虑前面求解过的问题：观测位于|Ψ⟩状态粒子的能量，所 得结果为E = E2 = n2π2 2mL2 的概率是多少？这个问题用Dirac 符号 可以简明地表示，概率为 图8.3: Stern-Gerlach 实验图示。实验在最初\n\n*\n\n+\n\nΨ =\n\nΨ P(E2) = E = n2π2\n\n\u0012Z dx |x⟩⟨x| \u0013 E = n2π2 使用银原子，它的自旋 仅由原子轨道最外层 2mL2 2mL2\n\n| {z } =ˆI 电子的自旋决定，因 此实验结果与电子相 2mL2 ||x⟩⟨x||Ψ⟩= Z dx Φ∗ 2(x)Ψ(x)\n\n= Z dx ⟨E = n2π2 同。一束粒子流通过不 答案与8.5.2节用波动力学标准方法的结果相同。\n\n均匀磁场，对于经典类 型的轨道角动量，粒 8.5.5 Spin 自旋 子在磁场偏离形成连 续分布。然而实验只 本节讨论5.1.1节所导出的新的角动量——自旋。关于自旋目 前我们有两条线索。首先，我们用自旋标记了Lorentz 群的表示。例 如描述自旋1 观测到两种偏离，即 2 的基本粒子需要用按照Lorentz 群1 2 表示进行变换 粒子流经磁场后只分 为两束，一束为自旋 的对象。其次，自旋是旋转对称性对应守恒量的一部分23。5.1.1节 导出的自旋算符作用于态矢给出粒子的自旋。对于标量表示（所 1 2，另一束为−1 2。图片 作者为Theresa Knott 描述的粒子），自旋算符ˆS = 0，即标量粒子任意状态的自旋为0. 再考虑(1 2, 0) 表示，用二维矩阵表示的旋转生成元为（推导 (Wikimedia Com见3.7.5节）： mons)distributed under a CC BY-SA 3.0 license:\n\nˆSi = σi 2 (8.46) http://creativeco mmons.org/licenses 其中σi 为Pauli 矩阵。描述粒子自旋的状态记作Ψ，下面将自旋 算符作用与Ψ. 例如算符ˆS3 作用的结果是粒子自旋在第3 方向，\n\n/by-sa/3.0/deed.en 图片地址：https://up load.wikimedia.org 通常称为z 方向的分量。同样ˆS2 表示自旋y 分量，ˆS1 表示x 分 量。\n\n/wikipedia/commons /e/ee/Stern-Gerlach 算符ˆS3 的显式形式为 2 = \u0012 1\n\n\u0013 (8.47)\n\nˆS3 = σ3 2 0 0 −1\n\n_experiment_svg.svg 2 8.5 从波动方程到粒子的运动 163 相应的本征态为 2 = \u00121 0\n\n\u0013 v−1 2 = \u00120 1\n\n\u0013 (8.48) v 1 相应的本征值分别为1 2, −1 2。这意味着旋量24描述的粒子的自旋 24 回顾：旋量是坐标变换下按 照Lorentz 群的( 1 为1 2，方向与坐标轴平行或反向。自旋1 2 , 0) 表示或 (0, 1 2 表示的名字正是来源于 此。量子理论诠释为自旋只能取1 2 ) 表示或( 1 2 , 0) ⊕(0, 1 2 ) 表 示变换的量。\n\n2 或−1 2。4.5.4节讲过，自旋与 轨道角动量有些相似，它们都源自旋转不变性。从上面的讨论可 见自旋的观测结果有着奇特的性质，该性质最著名的实验验证是 Stern-Gerlach 实验（见图8.3）。\n\n自旋的这一性质在任意方向都成立。测量自旋的x, y 或z 分 量的结果都只可能有1 2 或−1 2. 下面看一个用量子理论描述自旋测量的例子。前面（(5.4)式） 说过，自旋算符（以z 分量为例）的显式形式为： 2σ3 = \u0012 1\n\n\u0013 (8.49)\n\nˆSz = 1 2 0 0 −1 2\n\n\u0013 以及|−1\n\n\u0013 ，其中下标z 表示与ˆSz 有 2⟩z ˆ= \u00121 0 2⟩z ˆ= \u00120 1 本征态为|1 关。一般的旋量并非本征态自旋，而是它们的线性叠加，即|X⟩= a|1 2⟩z + b| −1 2⟩z. 系数决定特定状态。如果观测一束粒子流的z 分 量，并“过滤”掉自旋−1 2 的部分10，则筛选后的粒子自旋状态的 系数b = 0, a = 1，在筛选之前，状态为a = b = 1 √ 2，这意味着 两种自旋的概率25相等均为1 2。先后测量粒子自旋在不同方向分量 25 系数a, b 与概率幅直接相关， 下面就会看到。\n\n（例如，先测量Sz 再测量Sx）的结果十分有趣。即便把所有自旋 2 粒子都剔除出去，其余的仍有Sx = −1\n\n−1 2 的粒子。 自旋算符ˆSz 作用于态矢意味着测量自旋的z 分量。对于一般 2 或−1 状态|X⟩，测量结果为1 2 的概率由系数a, b 决定。如果测 量结果为−1 2 的概率已知，则相应的概率幅为 z⟨−1 2||X⟩= a z⟨−1 2||1\n\n+b z⟨−1 2|| −1\n\n= b.

Feynman, Robert B.Leighton, and Matthew Sands. The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume 3. Addison Wesley, 1st edition, 1 1971. ISBN 9780201021189 8.6 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle Heisenberg 不确定 性原理 现在可以讨论量子力学中最奇妙的特征之一了。从上节可知， 对粒子自旋x 分量的测量会破坏已知的自旋z 分量的信息，这一 情况在量子力学的很多测量中都存在。我们可以从27 ˆSx ˆSz ̸= ˆSz ˆSx 出发来考察这一点，此式说明先对自旋z 分量后对x 分量进行测 量和先对x 分量后对z 分量进行测量的结果是不同的。这一点并 27 我们把自旋算子和对应的有 限维旋转生成元认同，其满足对 易关系[Ji, Jj] = JiJj −JjJi = iϵijkJk ̸= 0 →JiJj ̸= JjJi。举 个例子来说，描述自旋1/2 的粒 子应采用对应的二维表示Ji = σi 不令人惊奇，因为对z 方向自旋进行测量后，系统应处于ˆSz 的一 个本征态上，而对x 方向自旋进行测量后，系统应处于ˆSx 的本征 态上，ˆSz 和ˆSx 的本征态均不同，最后的结果也就不同。\n\n2 。\n\n上述现象可以从另一视角描述：自旋的x 分量与z 分量不能 同时确定！每次测量z 方向的自旋时，都会让x 方向的自旋信息 再次变为未知，反之亦然。这一结论对于z 方向/x 方向和y 方向 的自旋也是一样的。 你也许觉得自旋是比较奇怪的物理量，但在粒子位置和动量 的测量上也发现了同样的结果。回顾一下式(5.3)，为了方便重写 一遍： [ˆpi, ˆxj] = ˆpiˆxj −ˆxj ˆpj = iδij (8.62) 由上可见，对粒子位置的x 分量进行测量，会导致之前对动量x 分量的测量结果变得不确定。换句话说，我们不能同时足够精确 地确定粒子在同一方向上的位置与动量。注意，只有沿相同方向 166 Chapter 8. 量子力学 的位置和动量算符的对易子才不为零28，所以测量动量的y 分量 不会干扰对位置的x 分量的测量。 每次测量动量会使位置信息变得不确定，反之亦然，这就是著 名的Heisenberg 不确定原理。同样的现象也发生在的角动量的 不同分量之间，因为它们的对易子不为零。总而言之，我们可以计 算任意两个物理量的对易性，如果它们不对易，它们就不能同时 足够精确地被确定。\n\n这其实不太奇怪。量子力学使用相应对称性的生成元作为测 29 复习：系统的平移不变性导出 动量守恒定律。\n\n量算符，比如说，对动量的测量等价于平移生成元的作用29，这一 生成元将我们的系统平移了一小点，所以粒子的位置也被改变了。\n\n真正令人惊奇的是大自然就是这么运作的，许多年来有很多实验 验证Heisenberg 不确定原理，它们都证明了这个原理的正确性。\n\n8.7 Comments on Interpretations 对几种诠释的评议 本章采用的都是量子力学的标准诠释与通用符号，然而还有 其他同样有效的体系。例如，就结果而言，Feynman 路径积分体 30 这方面内容可参考Richard P. Feynman and Albert R. Hibbs. Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals: Emended Edition. Dover Publications, emended editon edition, 7 2010. ISBN 9780486477220 31Harry Woolf, editor. Some Strangeness in the Proportion. Addison-Wesley, 1st edition, 2 1981. ISBN 9780201099249 系30与本章描述的波动力学完全等价。但二者的计算过程相当不 同。在路径积分体系中计算粒子从点a 到b 的概率，需要将从a 到b 的所有可能的路径叠加。尽管听起来很奇怪，但是可以证明 它的计算结果和波动力学相同。Freeman Dyson 曾经讲过关于路 径积分的一个故事31： Dick Feynman 向我讲述他量子力学“历史态叠加”的 新理论。“电子它想干啥就干啥”，他说：“它朝着任 意方向以任何速度往过去或未来行进，不管它怎么跑， 你把这些的振幅全加起来，就能得到波函数。”我对他 说：“你疯啦。”但实际上他没疯。\n\n量子力学基本方程的另一种基本诠释（比起路径积分更加偏 离主流）是Bohm 诠释。它的出发点是在Schrödinger 方程中加 入拟设项ReSt. 方程的实部与虚部构成两个方程，其中一个可以 类比为经典力学中的Hamilton-Jacobi 方程（有附加项，附加项可 以解释为与量子效应有关的额外势能），进一步的计算就与经典力 学非常相似。对额外势求梯度得到新的力，可以带入Newton 的经 典方程F = ma 中。因此在Bohm 诠释中仍然存在经典的粒子轨 道。据我所知，Bohm 诠释的计算结果与标准非相对论量子力学的 计算结果相同。然而由于额外势的非定域性使得它不受欢迎。\n\n32Richard P.

此不相互作用，我们在7.7.1节中有过解释。\n\n我们自然界中的每一个粒子都有它对应的反粒子，而其反粒 子的描述就是通过对粒子的荷进行共轭操作。荷的共轭操作会翻 转所有的粒子的标签，当然包括同位旋。我们可以看看，对应于电 子，其对应什么样的粒子。我们有\n\n• 一个左手手性的电子χL，同位旋−1 2，带电−e，处于双重态。\n\n• 一个右手手性的反-左手手性电子(χL)c = χR，将有同位旋 1 2，电荷+e，也同样是处于双重态。这种特性不会因为荷共 轭就消失。这可能看起来有点迷茫，但是到现在为止我们只 讨论粒子15间弱力带来的耦合。右手反粒子也会被弱相互作 用耦合。\n\n• 右手电子ξR，同位旋0，电荷−e。 • 左手反-右手手性电子(ξR)c = ξL，同位旋0，电荷+e。\n\n因此，当讨论电子的时候，我们实际上有四种不同的需要考虑 的“东西”。因为他们都是不同的粒子，我们实际上需要给他们不 同的名字！一般我们只会说两种：电子和正电子，我们马上会看到 这意味着什么。 我们接下来的讨论仅限于问题中的粒子静止的参考系。在其 他的参考系中，这些讨论是类似的，但是会有琐碎的细节。\n\nDirac 旋量和其荷共轭与这四种粒子直接相关。物理的电子和 物理的正电子一般被认为是DIrac 方程的解。Dirac 方程是运动方 程，也就是决定粒子的动力学的方程，其解为DIrac 旋量的时间 演化。我们需要求出来我们的粒子的时间演化，这就需要我们同 时考虑这两种粒子。\n\n附录8.9节中有严格的推导，这里仅给出结论。Dirac 方程有四 个线性无关的解，其中两个有形式\n\nψi = \u0012ui ui\n\n\u0013 (8.63) 比如38u1 = \u00121 0\n\n\u0013 e−imt 和u2 = \u00120 1\n\n\u0013 e−imt，而另外两个有形式 38 这实际上是一种基的选取。任 何选取只需要线性无关就可以。\n\n15而不是反粒子，切记切记 8.8 附录：Dirac 旋量分量的诠释 169\n\n¯ψi = \u0012−vi vi\n\n\u0013 (8.64)\n\n\u0013 e+imt 和v2 = \u00120 1\n\n\u0013 e+imt。\n\n比如v1 = \u00121 0 Dirac 方程告诉我们两个粒子的自旋由Dirac 旋量里面的上下 Weyl 旋量来描述。不仅如此，他们的时间依赖必须一样。这些解 就是我们通常认为的不同自旋的物理电子( physical electron) 和物理正电子(physical positron)39。\n\n39 注意这些解彼此之间的荷共 轭。利用荷共轭算符来仔细计算： ψc 1 = iγ2ψ∗ 1，因此(ψ1)c = ¯ψ2， 而(ψ2)c = ¯ψ1。\n\n• ψ1 是自旋向上的电子\n\n• ψ2 是自旋向下的电子 • ¯ψ1 是自旋向上的电子\n\n• ¯ψ2 是自旋向下的电子 我们可以看到一个物理电子有一个左手（上面的两分量）和 右手（下面的两分量）成分。一个物理电子的左右手成分的自旋、 时间依赖必须是一样的。就如上面所讨论的，左手和右手成分的 行为是非常不一样的，因为他们有不同的弱荷！而为了描述他们 的动力学，物理电子必须同时有这两个成分。\n\n注意这些解并不意味着我们用来描述物理电子用的是严格的 上和下分量。只需要他们的自旋和时间依赖必须一样。上部分仍 然是双重态，而下部分则不是。上部分按照SU(2) 变化而下部分 不是。用前面的符号来看的话，我们有\n\n\u0013 ∝ \u0012u u\n\n\u0013 物理电子= \u0012χL ξR (8.65) 这并不说明χL = ξR。Weyl 旋量χL 是有同位旋的双重态，而由 ξR 描述的粒子则没有同位旋。不仅如此，我们也知道了Dirac 旋 量里面的上和下Weyl 旋量在Lorentz 推动下是不一样变化的。因 此，我们使用不同的记号是非常有必要的。换句话说，左手电子\n\nχL 带一个SU(2) 指标，因为χL 按照SU(2) 双重态的一部分来 变换。ξR 则没有指标，按照SU(2) 单重态来变化呢。\n\n一样的，我们有 物理正电子= \u0012−ξL χR\n\n\u0013 ∝ \u0012−v v\n\n\u0013 (8.66) 40 见第7.1.5节，并利用(6.13)定 义的矩阵的精确形式：γ2 = \u0012 0 ¯ σ2 σ2 0 我们可以通过荷共轭看到40\n\n\u0013 = \u0012 0 −σ2 σ2

候都是两种粒子的叠加：携带同位旋的左手电子和无同位旋的右 170 Chapter 8. 量子力学 手电子！一样的我们知道，物理正电子也是由携带同位旋的反-左 手电子和无同位旋的反-右手粒子的混合。 Dirac 方程的解则告诉我们粒子如何进行时间演化。比如说我 们考虑在一个弱相互作用下出现的一个自旋向上的电子，然后它 如何进行时间演化呢？首先他是一个纯的左手电子，可以写为\n\n\n\n 1 0

记得两种不同的粒子eL，eR 有不同的弱荷，即同位旋，而时 间演化可以使二者互相转换。大多数时候它们都是两种的混合物， 而不是确切的处于某个本征态。同位旋和手性因此在时间演化中 就不守恒。\n\n我们现在可以看到Dirac 旋量的符号是必须的，因为我们有 一个封闭的将本节开始提到的四种粒子中任意两种联系起来的动 力学行为。手性和同位旋在传播过程中也就不守恒了。可以发现， 同一个电子，随着时间演化有时处于左手态，有时也会处于右手 态。\n\n8.9 附录：解Dirac 方程 171 8.9 Appendix: Solving the Dirac Equation 附录：解Dirac 方 程 和上节一样，我们把Dirac 自旋量中的二分量量记做u 和v， 把四分量量记做u 和v。也就是说例如u1, u2 的记号代表的是四 分量量，在不特别区分这些量的时候我们只写u。同时u1 和u2 是这个四分量量中的两个二分量量：u = \u0012u1 u2\n\n\u0013 。\n\n本附录中我们将在手性基底上解静止参考系下的Dirac 方程。 其他任意参考系的解能够通过本节解做伪转动变换得到。除了我 们在上一节的讨论，我们在第9章讨论量子场论的时候也会用到这 些解。\n\nDirac 方程为： (i∂µγµ −m)ψ = 0 (8.72) 我们考虑其平面波解，设Ψ = ue−ipx，其中u 是一四分量量，因 为矩阵γµ 是4 × 4 的。在静止参考系中，三维动量⃗p = 0, 指数项 因此变为−ipx = −i(p0x0 −⃗p⃗x) = −ip0x0。现在使用我们本章初 推导得到的相对论能量动量关系E = p\n\n|⃗p|2 + m2，已知p0 = E 和x0 = t，我们得到−ipx = −iEt = −i p\n\n|⃗p|2 + m2t = −imt。把 此式带入到Dirac 方程中： (i∂µγµ −m)ue−imt = 0\n\n→(i(∂0γ0 −∂iγi) −m)ue−imt = 0\n\n→(i(−im)γ0 −m)ue−imt = 0\n\n→(mγ0 −m)u = 0\n\n→( \u00120 1 1 0\n\n\u0013 − \u00121 0 0 1\n\n\u0013 )u

Quantum Field Theory 量子场论 总结剧透 译注：本节的内容是介绍本章将要做些什么也就是剧透，第一 遍读不懂属于正常情况。\n\n本章介绍量子场论的基本框架。由第5章导出的公式 [Φ(x), π(y)] = iδ(x −y) 可见场本身就是算符。自旋为0, 1/2, 1 的场的运动方程的解是用 1Fourier 变换背后的思想在附 录D.1中进行了解释。\n\n场的Fourier 展开1写出来的。从上式的对易关系可见Fourier 系 数也是算符。之后，我们会看到这些算符（当然还包括导出它们的 场）是如何产生和湮灭粒子的，用对应场的拉格朗日量可以导出 代表能量的哈密顿算符。\n\n之后建立相互作用理论，它是量子场论的核心。我们会看到在 相互作用理论中，哈密顿量是由自由场的哈密顿量和相互作用的 哈密顿量线性组合而成的。这一思路之后可应用于相互作用绘景 中，在这个绘景下场的时间演化是由自由哈密顿量主导的，而态 的时间演化是由相互作用哈密顿量主导的。在这个绘景下，能够 推导出散射过程的几率幅，用Dirac 记号可以表示成\n\n⟨f| ˆS|i⟩, 这里ˆS 表示描述散射过程的算符，|i⟩是初态，⟨f| 是末态。我 们会发现算子ˆS 可以用相互作用哈密顿量HI 写成\n\nˆS(t, ti) = e−i R t ti dt′HI. 178 Chapter 9. 量子场论 这个式子解不出来，因此采用级数展开式来计算这个指数。对 于大多数实验而言，前面几项就足以精确的描述了。 级数展开中的每一项可以解释为描述不同种类的散射过程。相 互作用哈密顿量包含了场的线性组合，就如上面提到的，是用来 产生或者湮灭场的。对于最低的非平凡阶次，我们得到8 项，且 第一项描述了一个从e−e+ →γ 的散射过程。这意味着我们从一 个由电子和正电子组成的初态|e−e+⟩出发，这个初态被自旋1/2 的场算符湮灭，并且之后一个光子⟨γ| 由光子场产生。其他项作用 在初态|e−e+⟩时的结果是0。 这个级数的下一阶由许多项组成，我们只考虑其中的一项，同 样地，从初态|e−e+⟩开始，其中的一项描述了过程e−e+ →γ → e−e+, 这里初末的正负电子对一般具有不同的动量。\n\n同样地，所有这些项可以理解成所有的相互作用哈密顿量。一 种简化这类计算的图形化方法是著名的Feynman 图。在这个图中 每一条线，每一个顶点代表了上面计算的东西的一个因子。\n\n9.1 Field Theory Identifications 对应到场理论 本节探究从对称性限制得到的拉格朗日量是怎样应用到场论 的框架中的。要得到一个描述自然界的场论，第一步是将拉格朗 日量和第5章内容，尤其是(5.5)式1结合起来，为了方便，将(5.5)式 重写一遍： [Φ(x), π(y)] = iδ(x −y) (9.1) 其中共轭动量密度π(y) 为\n\nπ(y) = ∂L ∂(∂0Φ(y)) (9.2) 9.2 Free Spin 0 Field Theory 自旋为0 的自由场理论 “一个产生的艺术首先是一个毁灭的艺术。”\n\n2 引自Rollo May,The Courage to Create.W.W.Norton and Company,reprint edition,3 1994. ISBN 9780393311068\n\n——Pablo Picasso2 从最简单的例子——自由的0 自旋场——出发，它由在Lorentz 变换下不变的标量来描述（在3.7.4节推导）。我们已经在6.2节中推 出了相对应的拉格朗日量2 L = 1 2(∂µΦ∂µΦ −m2Φ2) (9.3) 它的运动方程叫做Klein-Gordon 方程 (∂µ∂µ + m2)Φ = 0 (9.4) 1译注：似乎应该为(5.6)式。\n\n2原文下式有误，译文已按勘误表修改。\n\n9.2 自旋为0 的自由场理论 179 可直接计算出共轭动量\n\n\u0010 ∂µΦ(x)∂µΦ(x)−m2Φ2(x) \u0011 = ∂0Φ(x)\n\nπ(x) = ∂L ∂(∂0Φ(x)) = ∂ ∂(∂0Φ(x)) 1 2 3 如果想知道关于积分测度的详 细的计算过程，以及为什么写出 这种形式的解的验证请看本章最 后9.6的附录。\n\nKlein-Gordon 方程的最一般的解可以写成Fourier 展开的形式3\n\nΦ(x) = Z dk3 1 (2π)32ωk\n\n\u0000 a(k)e−ikx + b(k)eikx\u0001 (9.5) 其中3ω2 k ≡⃗k2 + m2, 如果限制在实标量场的情况上式可写为\n\nΦ(x) = Z dk3 1 (2π)32ωk\n\n\u0000 a(k)e−ikx + a†(k)eikx\u0001 (9.6) 因为c + c† = Re(c) + i · Im(c) | {z } c + Re(c) −i · Im(c) | {z } c† = 2Re(c). 现在考虑方程(9.1)，即不为零的对易子[Φ(x), π(y)] ̸= 0 有 什么含义。这意味着Φ(x) 和π(y) 不是普通的函数而必须是算 符，因为一般的函数是对易的：(3 + x)(7xy) = (7xy)(3 + x)。由 方程(9.6)可以得到结论：Fourier 系数a(k) 和a(k)† 是算符，因为 e±ikx 只是复数，而复数是对易的。\n\n4 例如可以参考Lewis H.Ryder 书的4.1 节，Quantum Field Theory. Cambridge University Press, 2nd edition, 6 1996. ISBN 9780521478114 从方程(9.1)可以计算出4 [a(k), a†(k′)] = (2π)3δ3(⃗k −⃗k′) (9.7) [a(k), a(k′)] = 0 (9.8) [a†(k), a†(k′)] = 0 (9.9) 既然已经知道场就是算符，接下来自然要问：它作用在什么上面？ 在粒子理论中，动力学变量与算符相等同，算符作用的数学对象 （波函数，抽象的Dirac 右矢等等）描述粒子。在场论中，目前没 有什么东西来描述粒子。在这一点上，粒子是怎么出现在场论中是 完全不清楚的。然而，通过考虑场的展开系数a(k) 和a†(k) 作用 于什么抽象的数学对象上，就可以知道场作用在什么对象上的了。 为了建立直观认识，我们从熟悉的能量入手。\n\n一个标量场的能量E 由时间平移不变性导出的方程(4.40)给 出： E = Z d3xT 00\n\n\n\n\n\n= Z d3x\n\n   ∂L ∂(∂0Φ) ∂Φ ∂x0 |{z} ∂0Φ\n\n  \n\n−L\n\n= Z d3x \u0012 ∂0Φ)2 −1 2(∂µΦ∂µΦ −m2Φ2 \u0013 3原文此式有误，译文已按勘误表修改。\n\n180 Chapter 9. 量子场论 Z d3x \u0010 (∂0Φ)2 + (∂iΦ)2 + m2Φ2\u0011 1 2 (9.10)\n\n= |{z} ∂µ∂µ=∂0∂0−∂i∂i 将方程(9.6)代入方程(9.10)，并利用对易关系(9.7) ∼(9.9) 式可得 Z dk3 1 (2π)3 ωk \u0010 a†(k)a(k) + a(k)a†(k) \u0011 E = 1 2 2(2π)3δ3(0) \u0013\n\n\u0012 a†(k)a(k) + 1 Z dk3 1 (2π)3 ωk (9.11)\n\n= |{z} (9.7)式 这时我们的理论发散了，积分中的第二项是无穷大的。我们可以在 这里停下并且说这个理论无效。然而，一些勇敢的人进行了深入 的探索，忽略无穷大项并且发现了一个精确描述自然的理论。从 这里继续的标准的做法就是忽略第二项，这种做法的可行性尚未 得到解释。不过这里的关键在于发散项出现在每个系统的能量中， 并且我们只能测量能量的差值。因此这个无穷大的常数项不会对 测量造成影响。\n\n按照习惯，写作算符的能量叫做哈密顿量ˆH, 我们可以计算 ˆH 和Fourier 系数a(k) 以及a†(k) 的对易子5。我们得到了 5 之后会看到它有什么用。\n\n[ ˆH, a†(k′)] = Z dk3 1 (2π)3 ωk[a†(k)a(k), a†(k′)] Z dk3 1 (2π)3 ωka†(k)[a(k), a†(k′)]\n\n= |{z} [a†(k),a†(k′)]=0\n\n= Z dk3 ωka†(k)δ3(k −k′)\n\n= |{z} 见附录D.2 ωk′a†(k′) (9.12) 同样的 [ ˆH, a(k′)] = −ωk′a(k′) (9.13) 量子理论中的算符作用于描述系统状态的数学对象上（见8.3节）。 在这个情况下，如果用能量算符，即哈密顿算符ˆH 作用在抽象的 对象|?⟩上来描述物理系统，就能得到系统的能量：\n\nˆH|?⟩= E|?⟩ (9.14) 6 记住：场= 算符 现在回到开始的那个问题：场6是如何作用于物理系统的？先来考 7 这里我们采取了非常聪明的处 理方式，它是Dirac 在处理量子 力学中谐振子的问题时首先被引 入的 虑7第一个Fourier 系数（它是个算符）对于系统能量的影响：\n\nˆH \u0010 a(k′)|?⟩ \u0011 = \u0010 a(k′) ˆH + ˆHa(k′) −a(k′) ˆH | {z } [ ˆH,a(k′)]\n\n\u0011 |?⟩\n\n+[ ˆH, a(k′)]|?⟩\n\n= a(k′) ˆH|?⟩ |{z} =E|?⟩ 9.2 自旋为0 的自由场理论 181\n\n= \u0010 a(k′)E + [ ˆH, a(k′)] \u0011 |?⟩\n\n\u0010 a(k′)E −ωk′a(k′) \u0011 |?⟩\n\n= |{z} 方程(9.13)\n\n= (E −ωk′)a(k′)|?⟩ (9.15) 同样地，对于第二个Fourier 系数有\n\nˆHa†(k′)|?⟩= (E + ωk′)a†(k′)|?⟩ (9.16) 它们该如何解释？我们看到a(k′)|?⟩可以理解成一个具有能量E −\n\nωk 的新系统。更确切的，我们定义\n\n|?2⟩≡a(k′)|?⟩ 于是\n\nˆH|?2⟩= |{z} (9.15)式 (E −ωk′)|?2⟩ 它暗示了场的作用效果。想象一个真空态系统|0⟩，依定义有H|0⟩= 0|0⟩。如果用a†(k′) 作用于真空态|0⟩，由上可知它将真空的体系 变到了一个具有能量ωk′ 的体系\n\nˆHa†(k′)|0⟩= |{z} (9.16)式 ωk′a†(k′)|0⟩ (9.17) 可见a†(k′) 在一个全空的体系中产生了一些具有能量为ωk′ 的东 西，我们把它叫做一个动量为k′ 的粒子！如果再用a†(k′) 作用在 这个系统上一次，就得到了具有相同动量的第二个粒子。如果用 a†(k′′) 作用，就可以得到具有动量k′′ 的粒子等等。因此，a† 称为 产生算符。与a†(k′) 的理解过程类似，a(k′) 破坏或者湮灭一个具 有能量为ωk′ 的粒子，所以叫做湮灭算符或消灭算符。为了使其更 加精确，我们引入关于粒子态的记号 a†(k)|0⟩≡|1k⟩ (9.18) a†(k)|1k⟩≡|2k⟩ (9.19) a†(k′)|2k⟩≡|2k, 1k′⟩ (9.20) 再来看一下能量 E = Z dk3 1 (2π)3 ωka†(k)a(k). 如果这个算符作用在像|2k1, k2⟩这样的态上会发生什么呢？结果 应该是 E = 2ωk1 + ωk2 182 Chapter 9. 量子场论 它是两个能量为ωk1 和一个能量为ωk2 的粒子的能量之和。因此， 出现在这里的算符 N(k) ≡a†(k)a(k) (9.21) 是粒子数算符，记作N(k)，它可以从一个态中提取出动量为k 的 粒子的数目 N(k)|nk, n′ k, . . . ⟩= nk|nk, n′ k, . . . ⟩. (9.22) 这时，能量算符可以写成 E = Z dk3 1 (2π)3 ωkN(k) 8 例如硬盒中的粒子，它的动量 谱是离散的。假设问题中的系统 是局限在有限的体积V 中是量 子场论中一个常用的技巧，在计 算的最后我们再取V →∞这个 极限。\n\n此外，注意到有些物理系统的动量谱是离散而非连续的8，对于这 些系统，所有的积分变成了求和，比如能量的形式为 E = X k ωkN(k). 对易关系变成了 [a(k), a†(k′)] = δk,k′ (9.23) 注意量子场论就像量子力学一样，是一个做概率性预言的理论。因 此物理态需要归一化⟨k, k′, . . . |k, k′, . . . ⟩= 1, 因为超过100% = 1 的概率没有意义。如果用一个像a†(k) 这样的算符作用在右矢上， 所得新的右矢的模不一定是1，因此可以写为 a†(k)|nk⟩= C|nk + 1⟩ (9.24) 其中nk 是动量为k 的粒子数，C 是某个常数。上式取厄米共轭得 9|nk⟩† = ⟨nk|, 当然也有 (a†)† = a. 到9： (a†(k)|nk⟩)† = (C|nk + 1⟩)†\n\n→⟨nk|a(k) = ⟨nk + 1|C† (9.25) 由此可得 a†(k)|nk⟩ | {z } 方程(9.24)\n\n= ⟨nk+1| C†C |{z} 一个数而不是算符 |nk+1⟩= C†C ⟨nk + 1||nk + 1⟩ | {z } =1 (9.26)\n\n⟨nk|a(k) | {z } 方程(9.25) 或者用离散的对易关系(方程(9.23)) 写为\n\n⟨nk|a(k)a†(k)|nk⟩= ⟨nk|( a†(k)a(k) | {z } =N(k),见(9.21)式\n\n)|nk⟩\n\n+ δk,k |{z} =1 9.2 自旋为0 的自由场理论 183 方程(9.22) z}|{ = ⟨nk| (nk + 1) | {z } 一个数而不是算符\n\n|nk⟩= (nk + 1) ⟨nk||nk⟩ | {z } =1 (9.27) 结合方程(9.26)和(9.27)得到 C†C = nk + 1 →C = √nk + 1 (9.28) 从而有 a†(k)|nk⟩= √nk + 1|nk + 1⟩ (9.29) 同样的步骤可得4 a(k)|nk⟩= √nk|nk −1⟩ (9.30) 这时出现了两个问题。首先，如果在全空的系统中湮灭一个粒子 会发生什么？第二：能量守恒和电荷守恒怎么办？如何能够从真 空产生一些东西而不违背守恒律？首先，守恒律从来没有被违背， 但是这一点只有在进一步深入这个理论之后才会变的清晰起来。\n\nRichard Feymann 也有同样的问题10，看一看或许对我们有帮助 10Feynman 的Nobel 演讲(December11,1965） 我记得当某个人教我关于产生和湮灭算符的时候，当说到这个算 符产生了一个电子，我说：“你怎么能够产生一个电子？它不符合 电荷守恒。”就这样，我从思想上的抵触阻碍了学习一个非常实际 的计算方法。\n\n第二，我们当然永远不能湮灭那些一开始就不存在的东西，如果 湮灭算符作用到一个全空的体系|0⟩, 从方程(9.30)得到 a(k)|0k⟩= √ 0|0k −1k⟩= 0 (9.31) 或者，同样地 a(k′)|1k⟩= √ 0|1k, 0k′ −1k′⟩= 0 (9.32) 由此可见，如果湮灭算符a(k′) 作用到一个不包含动量k′ 的粒子 的右矢（例如|k⟩）上，结果依然是0. 产生算符和湮灭算符出现 在场的Fourier 展开中，这个Fourier 展开包含了对于所有可能动 量的积分（或求和），因此当这些场作用到一个像|k⟩的右矢上时， 只有一个湮灭算符会导致不为0 的结果。这一点在我们试图用量 子场论来描述相互作用的时候是非常重要的。\n\n在开始研究相互作用之前，我们先来简单的看看自旋1/2 和 自旋1 的自由场。\n\n4原文此式有误，译文已按勘误表修改。\n\n184 Chapter 9. 量子场论 9.3 Free Spin 1 2 Theory 自旋1 2 的自由场理论 在6.3节已经推导了自旋1 2 自由场的运动方程——Dirac 方程： (iγµ∂µ −m)Ψ = 0 11Dirac 方程的求解过程 见(8.9)节，这与上节 KleinGordon 方程的过程相似。\n\nDirac 方程的一般解可以写成如下形式11 Z d3p √ωp r m (2π)3\n\n\u0010 cr(p)ur(p)e−ipx + dr(p)vr(p)e+ipx\u0011\n\nΨ = X r (9.33)\n\n= Ψ+ + Ψ− 与前面不同，这里不局限于实数场，因为6.3节表明Lorentz 不变 的拉格朗日量需要复的自旋1 2 场。按照惯例将通解写成 Z d3p √ωp r m (2π)3\n\n\u0010 cr(p)ur(p)e−ipx + d† r(p)vr(p)e+ipx\u0011\n\nΨ = X r (9.34) 因为这样，d† r(p) 可以看作是产生了一个反粒子。如果在解中把它 命名为dr(p) 会导致混淆，因为c† r(p) 产生而cr(p) 湮灭粒子。将 Fourier 系数命名为d† r(p) 而非dr(p)，使得反粒子也有相似的解 释：d† r(p) 产生而dr(p) 湮灭。\n\n6.3节还导出了伴随Dirac 方程： (i∂µ ¯Ψγµ + m¯Ψ) = 0 其解为 Z d3p √ωp r m (2π)3\n\n\u0010 c† r(p)¯ur(p)e+ipx + dr(p)¯vr(p)e−ipx\u0011\n\nΨ = X r (9.35)\n\n= Ψ+ + Ψ− 128.10节导出了静止参考系 (pi = 0) 下的旋量基底，任意 参考系下的旋量基底可以通过把 静止参考系下的旋量基底做一个 推动变换得到。\n\n其中u1,u2,v1,v2 是任意参考系下的“旋量基底”。12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 0 1 p1−ip2 1 0 p3 E+m p1+ip2 r r\n\n  \n\n  , u2 =\n\n  \n\n   E + m E + m u1 = 2m 2m E+m −p3 E+m E+m (9.36)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n p3 E+m p1+ip2 p1−ip2 r r E+m −p3 E+m 0 1\n\n  \n\n  , v2 =\n\n  \n\n  .

H ∼ Z c†c −d†d 这一形式表明反粒子的能量是负的。这是一个严重的问题，因为 任意一个态都可以无休止的衰变到更低能量的状态，宇宙中的任 何东西都不能是稳定的。和标量情况不同，这里的哈密顿量不是 有下界的。但如果用反对易关系来替代：\n\n{Φ(x), π(y)} = Φ(x)π(y) + π(y)Φ(x) = iδ(x −y) 则哈密顿量含有反粒子产生和湮灭算符的那一项变成了正的，问 题也就解决了。\n\n15 下式类似于标量场的(9.9)式， 但是现在用反对易子替换了对易 子[, ] →{, } 这个看上去很笨拙的技巧，却产生了非常有趣的结果。例如15\n\n{c†(k), c†(k′)} = 0 由此可得\n\n{c†(k), c†(k)} = c†(k)c†(k) + c†(k)c†(k) = 2c†(k)c†(k) = 0\n\n⇒c†(k)c†(k) = 0 (9.38) 16 对于自旋为0 的场，对应的 方程不是很令人吃惊，因为这里 我们用了对易子[c†(k), c†(k)] = c†(k)c†(k) −c†(k)c†(k) = 0 两个相同的产生算符作用得到的结果总是0！16。这意味着不能产 生两个相同的自旋1 2 粒子，这就是著名的Pauli 不相容原理。\n\n其他的Fourier 系数反对易关系可以通过场和共轭动量的反 对易关系得到：\n\n{cr(p), c† s(p′)} = δrsδ(p −p′)\n\n{dr(p), d† s(p′)} = δrsδ(p −p′) (9.39) 其他可能的组合都等于0. 因此，这些系数与上一节自旋0 的场的 系数具有相同的性质。它们产生和湮灭粒子，不同的是相同的算符 作用两次的结果是0。自旋1 2 自由场的哈密顿量可以和自旋0 的 自由标量场用相似的方式得到 1 2 free = Z d3x(−i¯Ψγi∂iΨ −m¯ΨΨ) (9.40) H 或者用Fourier 系数来表示 Z d3pωp \u0010 c† rcr(p) + d† r(p)dr(p) + const \u0011 (9.41) 1 2 free = X H r 这里常数项导致了一项无穷大的项，同样地，我们忽略它。\n\n186 Chapter 9. 量子场论 9.4 Free Spin 1 Theory 自旋1 的自由场理论 6.4节导出了自旋1 自由场的运动方程——Proca 方程： m2Aρ = 1 2∂σ(∂σAρ −∂ρAσ) (9.42) 它的解和自旋0 场的解是类似的，形式为 Aµ = Z d3k p\n\n\u0010 ϵr,µ(k)ar(k)e−ikx + ϵr,µ(k)a† r(k)eikx\u0011 (2π)32ωk (9.43) Aµ = A+ µ + A− µ (9.44) 这里ϵr,µ(k) 是基矢量，叫做偏振矢量。对于自旋1 的场，可 以使用对易子而非反对易子，因此系数ar, a† r 和自旋0 的场的系 数具有相同的性质。\n\n9.5 Interacting Field Theory 相互作用场论 下一步考虑不同自旋的场之间的相互作用。相应拉格朗日量 已经在先前章节中，通过Lorentz 对称性与规范对称性导出。举例 来说，有质量自旋1 2 场与无质量自旋1 场之间的相互作用，可用 以下拉格朗日量描述（方程(7.17)） LDirac+Extra-Term = −m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγµ∂µΨ + gAµ ¯ΨγµΨ (9.45) 由此可导出哈密顿量17 17 很快会用到这一哈密顿量！\n\nH = Z d3xT 00\n\n= Z d3x \u0010 ∂L ∂(∂0Ψ) | {z } i¯Ψγ0\n\n∂0Ψ −L \u0011\n\n= Z d3x \u0010 i¯Ψγ0∂0Ψ + m¯ΨΨ −i¯Ψ γµ∂µ | {z } γ0∂0−γi∂i\n\nΨ −gAµ ¯ΨγµΨ \u0011\n\n= Z d3x(m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγi∂iΨ) | {z }\n\n− Z d3x(gAµ ¯ΨγµΨ) | {z } ≡−HI\n\n=H 1 2 free 1 2 free + HI (9.46)\n\n= H 9.5.1 Scatter Amplitudes 散射振幅 计算动量为p1, p2, . . . , pn 的n 个粒子18转变为动量为q1, q2, . . . , qn′ 18 这便是物理学家在对撞实验 中所制备的。\n\n的数量、动量都可能不同的n′ 个粒子的概率，是量子场论的基本 目标之一。概率幅用Dirac 符号写为：\n\n⟨q1, q2, . . . , qn′| ˆS|p1, p2, . . . , pn⟩ (9.47) 9.5 相互作用场论 187 其中ˆS 为描述散射过程的算符。下一节将导出这一算符的具体形 式。在上式描述的过程中，初始时刻ti 时有数个粒子存在于空间 点xi，而在相互作用后的tf 时刻，（可能不同的）新粒子则存在 于新位置xf。 于是问题来了：量子场论如何描述量子态（记作|?⟩）的演化？\n\n9.5.2 Time Evolution of States 态的时间演化 为了解答这个问题，注意到能量算符一方面由时间平移算符 i∂0 给出，另一方面也是系统的哈密顿量。举例来说，自旋0 场有 哈密顿量 Z d3x \u0010 (∂0Φ)2 + (∂iΦ)2 + mΦ2\u0011 H0 free = 1 (9.48) 2 而自旋1 2 场有 1 2 free = Z d3x(m¯ΨΨ + i¯Ψγi∂iΨ) (9.49) H 考虑到“能量算符”在场论中的两种表示，可以写出 i∂0|?(t)⟩= H|?(t)⟩ (9.50) 这也是量子场论中态的演化方程。从这一方程出发，可以定义相 应的时间演化算符U(t)，其效果是将某一时刻的量子态变换到另 一时刻。为了简便，我们可取初始时刻t = 0，于是有19 19 一般来说|?(t)⟩= U(t = t′)|?(t′)⟩\n\n|?(t)⟩= U(t)|?(0)⟩ (9.51) 代入方程(9.50)有 i∂0U(t)|?(0)⟩= HU(t)|?(0)⟩ (9.52) 这一方程对任意|?(0)⟩成立，因此20 20 我们在5.1节的边注中讨论过 这一思路。\n\ni∂0U(t) = HU(t) (9.53) 可以找到通解 U(t) = e−i R t 0 dx0H (9.54) 代入即可验证： i∂0U(t) = HU(t) →i∂0e−i R t 0 dx0H = He−i R t 0 dx0H\n\n→i(−iH)e−i R t 0 dx0H = He−i R t 0 dx0H\n\n→He−i R t 0 dx0H = He−i R t 0 dx0H ✓ (9.55) 实验无法测量右矢|?(t)⟩，而只能测左矢与右矢的乘积，一般来说， 也就是下述形式的对象：\n\n⟨f(t)| ˆO|i(t)⟩, (9.56) 188 Chapter 9. 量子场论 其中ˆO 是某个算符，|i(t)⟩是初态，⟨f(t)| 是末态。此处量子态在 U 的作用下演化，而算符则不含时。这一稍有些任意的选择被称 为Schrödinger 绘景，下面将讨论其它不同的绘景。\n\n21 记得⟨f| = |f⟩† 将上式用时间演化算符表出，得到21\n\n⟨f(0)|U†(t) ˆOU(t)|i(0)⟩ (9.57) 这里有一个重要的思想：我们可以改变观点，认为算符ˆO 按照 U†(t) ˆOU(t) 的形式随时间演化，而左右矢都不含时。这种新观点 被称为Heisenberg 绘景。 下面讲一个在相互作用理论中非常有用的传统技巧。哈密顿 量总可以写成自由哈密顿量和相互作用哈密顿量的和（方程(9.46)） H = Hfree + HI (9.58) 这里的技巧便是混用上述两种观点：让量子态随HI 演化，而让 算符随Hfree 演化22。这个技巧非常有用，因为在这一观点下自由 22 注意在量子场论中场即是算 符 场论中的所有结果都可以加以利用。这种观点称为相互作用绘景。\n\n在相互作用绘景中，量子态是\n\n|i(t)⟩I ≡U† free|i(t)⟩S (9.59) 其中Ufree = e−i R t 0 dx0Hfree，指标S 表示Schrödinger 绘景，也 就是量子态随总哈密顿量演化，且算符不含时的标准观点。\n\n将方程(9.59)与(9.50)合并可得23相互作用绘景下的演化方程。\n\n23 这一形式的方程在 Schrödinger 绘景下成立。因此 需由|i(t)⟩I ≡U† free|i(t)⟩S 求 解|i(t)⟩S。在方程两边乘Ufree， 注意UfreeU† free = 1。由此可得 |i(t)⟩S = Ufree|i(t)⟩I。这一结 果随后可代入方程(9.50)。\n\ni∂0|i(t)⟩S = H|i(t)⟩S →i∂0Ufree|i(t)⟩I = HUfree|i(t)⟩I\n\n→i∂0e−i R t 0 dx0Hfree|i(t)⟩I = (Hfree + HI)e−i R t 0 dx0Hfree|i(t)⟩I\n\n→ |{z} 莱布尼兹律 (((((((((((( Hfreee−i R t 0 dx0Hfree|i(t)⟩I + ie−i R t 0 dx0Hfree∂0|i(t)⟩I\n\n= (\b\b\b Hfree + HI)e−i R t 0 dx0Hfree|i(t)⟩I\n\n→ie−i R t 0 dx0Hfree∂0|i(t)⟩I = HIe−i R t 0 dx0Hfree|i(t)⟩I\n\n→i∂0|i(t)⟩I = ei R t 0 dx0HfreeHIe−i R t 0 dx0Hfree | {z } =Hint I ,相互作用绘景下的相互作用哈密顿量\n\n|i(t)⟩I\n\n→i∂0|i(t)⟩I = Hint I |i(t)⟩I (9.60) 总之，此时量子态的时间演化实际上由相互作用哈密顿量Hint I 决 定。这一简短的方程在后续讨论中价值连城。\n\n现在回到最初的问题：怎么计算散射过程\n\n⟨f(tf)| ˆS(tf, ti)|i(ti)⟩ ? (9.61) 算符ˆS(tf, ti) 将ti 时刻的初态|i(ti)⟩变换为tf 时刻的末态\n\n|Ψ(tf)⟩。一般来说，末态不是一个确定的粒子态，而是多种可能结 9.5 相互作用场论 189 果的叠加。反过来说，若非如此则粒子物理学未免太过无聊：相互 作用会永远导致同样的结果。好在现实中的情况更加多变，任意 线性叠加都可能存在。这一点在详细讨论算符ˆS 后就能明了。\n\n具体来说，ˆS 将一个初态变换为一系列末态的线性叠加。为简 洁起见，下面用t 来表示tf，有24 24 这可以看成量子态|Ψ(t)⟩对 粒子态|f(t)⟩的级数展开。\n\nˆS(tf, ti)|i(ti)⟩= |Ψ(t)⟩= X\n\n|f(t)⟩ (9.62) f Sfi |{z} 复数 左乘⟨f′(t)|，只有一项非0\n\n⟨f(t)| X f Sfi|f(t)⟩= X\n\n= X f Sfi ⟨f′(t)||f(t)⟩ | {z } =δff′因为作为基矢的量子态正交 f Sfiδff′ = Sf′i (9.63) 于是这一过程发生的概率为|Sf′i|2。\n\n25 即方程(9.60)。为避免符号混 乱我们省略“int”，即相互作用 绘景的脚标。\n\n现在详述散射算符ˆS。出于这一目的，请回顾上面导出的时间 演化方程25\n\n→i∂t|Ψ(t)⟩I = Hint I |Ψ(t)⟩I (9.64) 利用方程(9.62)，上式可用初态和算符ˆS 重写为\n\n→i∂t ˆ S(t, ti)|i(ti)⟩I = HI ˆS|i(ti)⟩I\n\n→ |{z} 莱布尼兹律 i(∂t ˆ S(t, ti))|i(ti)⟩I + i ˆ S(t, ti) ∂t|i(ti)⟩I | {z } =0,因为|i(ti)⟩I不含时\n\n= HI ˆS|i(ti)⟩I 这对任意初态适用，于是 26 此处我们忽略了一个重要因 素：编时性。这将在下一节讨论。\n\ni∂t ˆS(t, ti) = HI ˆS (9.65) 有通解26\n\nˆS(t, ti) = e−i R t ti dt′HI (9.66) 乍一看问题很简单。已知HI 求上述积分，就得到了算符ˆS(t, ti)，再 将其作用到初态上就得到了不同过程的散射振幅。可惜这一积分却 无法求解。为在数学上简化问题的形式，初始时刻可取为ti = −∞， 末尾时刻可取为t = ∞。这样就避免了散射振幅的时间依赖性。比 如说，在粒子散射实验中，特定过程发生的概率在“碰撞”发生后 10−24 秒时，与“碰撞”后2 · 10−24 秒时就不尽相同，因为相互作 用还在持续！将时间尺度取得很大可以帮助避免这类问题，因为 这样一来，测量结果就是相互作用完全结束后的数据。\n\n190 Chapter 9. 量子场论 9.5.3 Dyson Series Dyson 级数 由于散射振幅的指数积分无法解析求解，我们把它展开成 Taylor 级数27\n\nˆS(−∞, ∞) = e−i R ∞ −∞dt′HI(t′)\n\n= 1 −i Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt1HI(t1)\n\n−∞ dt1HI(t1) \u0013 \u0012Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt2HI(t2) \u0013 + . . .\n\n\u0012Z ∞\n\n−1 2!\n\n(9.67) 这被称为Dyson 级数。注意第三项，HI(t1) 与HI(t2) 不是数值 而是作用于右矢的算符。所以应保证时间靠前的算符先作用于右 矢，之后再由时间靠后的算符作用。即算符应按照时间顺序依次 作用于右矢。反过来说，先将HI(t = 5s)，再将HI(t = 2s) 作用 于量子态是没有意义的。在上述级数中，若t1 < t2 \u0012Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt2HI(t2) \u0013 \u0012Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt1HI(t1) \u0013 而当t2 < t1 时则有 \u0012Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt1HI(t1) \u0013 \u0012Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt2HI(t2) \u0013 为此可定义抽象化的编时算符T： T{A(x)B(y)} := A(t1)B(t2) 若 t1 > t2 B(t2)A(t1) 若 t1 < t2 (9.68) 于是级数展开变成\n\nˆS(∞, −∞) = 1 |{z} S(0) −i Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt1HI(t1) | {z } S(1) 2!T \u001a\u0012Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt1HI(t1) \u0013 \u0012Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt2HI(t2) \u0013\u001b\n\n= −1\n\n+ . . .\n\n| {z } S(2) (9.69) 或者写为求和形式5 Z ∞ Z ∞\n\n−∞ dt2 · · · Z ∞\n\n∞ X (−i)n\n\nˆS(∞, −∞) =\n\n−∞ dt1\n\n−∞ dtn THI(t1)HI(t2) . . .

(10.3) 解这个微分方程就得到物体的运动轨迹x = x(t)。下一章有一个 关于经典力学这方面的例子。\n\n10.1 Relativistic Mechanics 相对论力学 拉格朗日形式提供了有关经典力学相当不同的一种视角。描 述一个粒子的运动需要一个方程。本书总是假设正确的方程是使 10.1 相对论力学 199 某物取极小值而导出的。第4章中已经讲过它必须是Lorentz 变换 下的不变量，否则不同惯性系的运动规律会不同。 在狭义相对论中有一个现成的Lorentz 不变量：时空间隔 （在2.1节推导） (ds)2 = (cdτ)2 = (cdt)2 −(dx)2 −(dy)2 −(dz)2 (10.4) 其中τ 是固有时（见2.2节）。(ds)2 的平方根自然是不变量，由此 可以构造一个用来取极小值，并且形式上最简单的量： S = Z Cdτ, 其中C是常数，dτ = 1 p (cdt)2 −(dx)2 −(dy)2 −(dz)2 c (10.5) 正确的常数应当是C = −mc2，即我们要使 S = −mc2 Z dτ (10.6) 取极小值。\n\n简明起见，只考虑一维情形： s (cdt)2 \u0012 1 −(dx)2\n\n\u0013 p dτ = 1 (cdt)2 −(dx)2 = 1 c2(dt)2 c c s r\n\n\u0012dx\n\n\u00132 = |{z} dx 1 −˙x2 1 −1\n\n= 1 c2 .

(10.12) 2 ˙x2 1 −˙x2 在˙x ≪c 的极限下可以忽略˙x/c 的高阶小量，于是拉格朗日量化 为： L = −mc2 + 1 2m ˙x2 −V (x) (10.13) 前面说过，拉格朗日量中−mc2 这样的常数对运动方程没有影响， 因此非相对论力学的拉格朗日量为： L = 1 2m ˙x2 −V (x) (10.14) 2m ˙x2 正是4.5.1节中 在外势场为零，即V (x) = 0 的情形下，L = 1 由Noether 定理导出守恒量所用的拉格朗日量。把(10.14)式的拉 格朗日量带入欧拉-拉格朗日方程(4.7)式可得：\n\n\u0012∂L\n\n\u0013 = 0\n\n∂L\n\n∂x −d dt\n\n∂˙x\n\n\u00121 2m ˙x2 \u0013 −d\n\n\u0012 ∂\n\n\u00121 2m ˙x2 −V (x) \u0013\u0013 = 0\n\n→∂\n\n∂x dt\n\n∂˙x\n\n→−∂\n\n∂xV (x) −d dt(m ˙x) = 0\n\n→d dt(m ˙x) = −∂\n\n∂xV (x) (10.15) 这正是本章开头导出的Newton 第二定律(10.3)式。\n\n11. Electrodynamics 电动力学 第7章已经导出了经典电动力学最重要的方程——非齐次Maxwell 方程（组）(7.22)式：\n\n∂σ(∂σAρ −∂ρAσ) = Jρ (11.1) 利用电磁张量1可将上式写为更紧凑的形式： 1 电磁张量 F σρ ≡(∂σAρ −∂ρAσ).\n\n∂σF σρ = Jρ (11.2) 7.1.6节导出了Jρ 为Noether 流，即∂ρJρ = 0. 这一守恒流即为宏 观理论中的四维电流。电磁张量F σρ 是反称张量（F σρ = −F ρσ）， 这可以从定义式F σρ ≡∂σAρ −∂ρAσ 直接看出，因此F σρ 只有6 个独立分量，其中三个是 F i0 = ∂iA0 −∂0Ai (11.3) 另外三个是\n\nϵijkϵkℓm∂ℓAm (11.4) F ij = ∂iAj−∂jAi = (δi ℓδj m−δi mδj ℓ)∂ℓAm = |{z}\n\nδi ℓδj m−δi mδj ℓ=ϵijkϵkℓm,证明作为习题 这些独立分量通常记为：\n\n∂iA0 −∂0Ai ≡Ei (11.5)\n\nϵijk∂jAk ≡−Bi (11.6) 因此 F i0 = Ei (11.7) 202 Chapter 11. 电动力学 F ij = ϵijkϵkℓm∂ℓAm = −ϵijkBk (11.8) 将非齐次Maxwell 方程组2重新写为：\n\n∂σF ρσ = ∂0F ρ0 −∂kF ρk = Jρ (11.9) 3ϵjkℓ∂kBℓ= \u0000 ∇× ⃗B \u0001j，后者 就是向量分析里面的旋度运算 （nabla 算子叉乘向量）。\n\n对于三个空间分量(ρ →i) 有3：\n\n∂0F i0 −∂kF ik = ∂0Ei + ϵikℓ∂kBℓ= Ji\n\n→∂t ⃗E + ∇× ⃗B = ⃗J (11.10) 对于时间分量（ρ = 0 分量）：\n\n∂0 F 00 |{z} =0,见F ρσ定义式 −∂kF 0k F µν=−F νµ z}|{ = ∂kF k0 = |{z} (11.7)式 ∂kEk = J0\n\n→∇· ⃗E = J0 (11.11) 这是非齐次Maxwell 方程组在工程等领域中的常用形式。\n\n11.1 The Homogeneous Maxwell Equations 齐次Maxwell 方 程组 定义对偶(dual) 电磁张量˜F µν 为四维Levi-Civita 符号4与电 磁张量的缩并： 4 四维Levi-Civita 符号ϵµνρσ 的定义见附录B.5.5。\n\n˜F µν = ϵµνρσF ρσ (11.12) 从F µν 的定义可以导出，F µν 与任意全反称张量（比如ϵµνρσ）缩 并后的导数为零，即：\n\n∂µ ˜F µν = ∂µϵµνρσ(∂σAρ −∂ρAσ) = 0 (11.13) 这一结论实际是如下命题的特殊情形：两个对称指标与两个反对 称指标缩并1所得结果为零5。以(11.13)式括号内的第一项为例： 5 详见附录B.5.4。\n\nϵµνρσ∂µ∂σAρ = 1 2(ϵµνρσ∂µ∂σAρ + ϵµνρσ∂µ∂σAρ) 1 2(ϵµνρσ∂µ∂σAρ + ϵσνρµ∂σ∂µAρ)\n\n= |{z} 重命名哑指标 1 2(ϵµνρσ∂µ∂σAρ −ϵµνρσ∂µ∂σAρ) = 0 √\n\n= |{z} ϵµνρσ=−ϵσνρµ,∂µ∂σ=∂σ∂µ (11.14) 同理可导出括号中的第二项为零。方程组6 6 下式代表ν = 0, 1, 2, 3 四个方 程组成的方程组。\n\n1例如，张量Aαβµν = Aαβνµ, µ, ν 是一对对称指标；张量Bρσηδ = −Bσρηδ, ρ, σ 是一对反称指标。一对对称指标与反称指标的缩并结果必为零（即所得张量 分量均为0）：Cαβ ηδ ≡AαβγφBγφηδ = 0. 11.2 Lorentz 力 203\n\n∂µ ˜F µν = 0 (11.15) 称为齐次Maxwell 方程组(homogeneous Maxwell equations)。从推导过程可见它源自电磁张量F µν 的定义。下面将 它写成用电场⃗E 与磁场⃗B 表示的形式，考虑ν = 0 对应的方程： 0 = ∂µ ˜F µ0\n\n= ∂µϵµ0ρσF ρσ\n\n= ∂0 ϵ00ρσ |{z} =0 F ρσ −∂iϵi0ρσF ρσ\n\n= |{z} ϵi0ρσ=0,对于ρ=0或σ=0 −∂iϵi0jkF jk\n\n= ∂iϵ0ijkF jk\n\n= |{z} (11.8)式 −∂i ϵ0ijkϵℓjk | {z } =2δiℓ Bℓ\n\n= −2∂iδiℓBℓ= −2∂iBi\n\n⇒∂iBi = 0, 用向量记号表示：∇· ⃗B = 0 (11.16) 考虑空间分量：ν = i 对应的方程可以导出：\n\n∇× ⃗E + ∂t ⃗B = 0 (11.17) 这是齐次Maxwell 方程组在应用领域中的常见形式。\n\n11.2 The Lorentz Force Lorentz 力 利用上一章导出的量子力学与经典力学的联系（Ehrenfest 定 理）可以推导出著名的Lorentz 力公式。考虑在电磁场中运动的非 相对论性且无自旋的粒子，其Schrödinger 方程包含电磁场的耦合 项（(8.24)式）7 7 该式是从与外电磁场耦合的 Klein-Gordon 方程导出，亦即， 从与自旋1 无质量场（电磁场） 耦合的自旋0 的粒子的拉格朗 日量导出的。因此推导的出发 点还是用来导出拉格朗日量的 Lorentz 对称性与规范对称性。\n\ni∂tΨ = \u0012 1 2m(⃗p −q ⃗A)2 + qΦ \u0013\n\nΨ (11.18)\n\n| {z } ≡H 定义该系统的动量8为⃗Π = ⃗p −q ⃗A, 则系统的哈密顿量为： 8 这个定义来自Noether 定理： 系统的平移不变性对应守恒量动量，∂L H = 1 2m|⃗Π|2 + qΦ\n\n∂˙x = Π. 有了哈密顿量，再重复与上一章相同的过程，就能得到类似(10.1)式 的结果。因为这里涉及到依赖于时间的算符，因而推导中包含对 时间的偏导数项： i ⟨[O, H]⟩+ ⟨∂ˆO d dt⟨ˆO⟩= 1\n\n∂t ⟩ i ⟨[⃗Π, H]⟩+ ⟨∂⃗Π dt⟨⃗Π⟩= 1\n\n→d\n\n∂t ⟩, 204 Chapter 11. 电动力学\n\n∂⃗Π/∂t ̸= 0, 因为⃗A 显含时间。将H 的具体形式带入得： 2m|⃗Π|2 + qΦ]⟩+ ⟨∂⃗Π dt⟨⃗Π⟩= 1 i ⟨[⃗Π, 1\n\n→d\n\n∂t ⟩\n\n+⟨∂⃗Π\n\n→d dt⟨⃗Π⟩= 1 i ⟨[⃗Π, 1 2m|⃗Π|2⟩+ 1 i ⟨[⃗Π, qΦ]⟩ | {z } =⟨q∇Φ⟩\n\n∂t ⟩. 最后一步中[⃗Π, qΦ] 的推导可类比于上一章中[ˆp, V ] 的推导（因为 [ ⃗A, Φ] = 0）。接下来计算[|⃗Π|2, ⃗Π]，它不等于零，因为各分量Πi 之间不对易：\n\n\u0012∂Aj\n\n\u0013 = −q [Πi, Πj] = −q\n\n∂xi −∂Ai (11.19) i ϵijk Bk |{z} =ϵkℓm ∂ ∂xℓAm i\n\n∂xj 上面利用了磁场定义⃗B = ∇× ⃗A 的指标形式。粒子的速度9定义 为⃗v ≡⃗Π/m，由此可得： 9（Newton 极限下）动量除以质 量即为速度：p = mv。\n\n* ∂⃗Π\n\n+ d dt⟨⃗Π⟩= ⟨q∇Φ⟩−⟨q(⃗v × ⃗B)⟩+\n\n∂t\n\n| {z }\n\n=−q ∂⃗ A ∂t\n\n*\n\n+\n\n∇Φ −∂⃗A d dt = −q⟨(⃗v × ⃗B)⟩+ q\n\n∂t\n\n| {z } =⟨E⟩,见(11.5)式 最终得到 d dt⟨⃗Π⟩≡FLorentz = −q \u0000 ⟨⃗v × ⃗B⟩+ ⟨E⟩ \u0001 . (11.20) 上式即为带电粒子在外电磁场中的运动方程，其解即为粒子轨迹。\n\n11.3 Coulomb Potential Coulomb 势 第7章讲过拉格朗日量具有内禀对称性，可以利用这一自由度 简化计算，也就是说将场进行内禀变换以使计算大大简化。只要进 行规范变换（使拉格朗日量不变），则变换前后的场蕴含的物理规律 是相同的。通常选择的规范是关于光子场Aµ 的，规定10∂µAµ = 0， 这称为Lorentz 规范。利用这一规范条件将非齐次Maxwell 方程 组简化为： 10 可以证明这一规范条件的存 在性（略），相关细节可参见电动 力学教材。\n\n∂σ(∂σAρ −∂ρAσ) = ∂σ∂σAρ = Jρ (11.21) 考虑静电情况，静止的电荷关于坐标系原点对称分布。求解外部 区域（无源，即Jρ = 0）的电磁场，外部区域的Maxwell 方程组 为2：\n\n∂σ∂σAρ = ∂0∂0Aρ −∂i∂iAρ = 0.

(12.1) 等号左侧是描述曲率的Einstein 张量Gµν，右侧是能量-动量张 量1Tµν，G 是引力常数。\n\n3 目前为止用到的度规 包 括 Minkowski 度 规\n\n\n\n 在现代观点——引力= 时空曲率的指导思想下，Einstein 场 1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 0 −1\n\n  \n\n   方程的形式比较容易导出2。怎么导出？首先，能量-动量守恒是最\n\nηµν = 重要的物理定律之一，这可以从时空的均匀性直接推导（见第四 章），在均匀时空中物理规律在时空的平移变换下不变。因此，将 和 Euclidean 度 规\n\n\n\n\n\n 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\n\nδij =\n\n. 时空的均匀性作为基本假设的话，能量与动量自然就是守恒的，这 一守恒定律的数学形式为(4.36式)：\n\n∂µTµν = 0. (12.2) 下面介绍描述关于曲率的数学工具，它是广义相对论繁琐计算的 根源。我们已经见过关于曲率的重要的量——度规，它用于计算 两点间距离3。由图??可见，弯曲空间中的两点间距与平直时空的 图12.1: 弯曲空间与平 直空间中的两点间距 两点不同，因而度规在曲率的数学描述中起到十分重要的作用。\n\n208 Chapter 12. 引力 现在就能“导出”Einstein 场方程了，因为能放在能动张量对 面的量只有一个：Einstein 张量Gµν。这是因为Einstein 张量是 度规gµν 及其一阶、二阶导数的函数中唯一1 的无散度4函数。不 4 即∂µGµν = 0. 管其多复杂，放到等号一边描述曲率的量只能是它，因为 Tµν = CGµν, 由∂µTµν = 0 →∂µGµν = 0. (12.3) 5 二阶张量是指它有两个指标 µν，这与散度为零一样也是限 制之一，因为Tµν 是二阶张量。\n\nEinstein 张量是二阶张量5，正好符合要求。\n\nEinstein 张量通过Ricci 张量Rµν、Ricci 标量R（即Ricci 张 量的迹：R ≡Rν ν）和度规张量gµν 定义： Gµν = Rµν −1 2Rgµν. (12.4) 其中Ricci 张量由Christoffel 符号Γµ νρ 定义： Rαβ = ∂ρΓρ βα −∂βΓρ ρα + Γρ ρλΓλ βα −Γρ βλΓλ ρα (12.5) 其中Christoffel 符号通过度规张量定义： 2gcd \u0012∂gca\n\n\u0013 = 1\n\nΓd ab = 1\n\n∂xb + ∂gcb\n\n∂xa −∂gab 2gcd(∂bgca+∂agcb−∂cgab).\n\n∂xc (12.6) 上面的式子复杂得吓人，这稍微揭示了广义相对论计算的繁复程 度。\n\n现在考虑物体在弯曲时空中的行为。设自由物体经过弯曲时 空中的A, B 两点，物体在A, B 之间的轨迹是怎样的？容易猜想 物体沿弯曲时空中两点间的最短路径（称为短程线）运动，确实如 此（证明略）。这样，给定质能分布Tµν 之后就可根据Einstein 场 方程计算度规与Christoffel 符号，从而得到自由质点的轨迹—— 短程线方程(geodesic equation)： d2xλ dt2 + Γλ µν dxµ dt dxν dt = 0. (12.7) 6 这一说法是过于简单的，正确 的概念需要微分几何的相关知 识，超出本书范围。\n\n测地线是流形上的两点间局域最短6的连线。\n\n7 一般将度规视为引力场。\n\n有趣的是，Einstein 将Christoffel 符号视作引力场7： 若Γµ νρ 消失，则（自由）质点沿直线匀速运动，因此\n\nΓµ νρ 描述了关于匀速直线的偏离，它们是引力场的分 8Albert Einstein. The foundation of the general theory of relativity. 1916 量。\n\n— Albert Einstein8 1译注：至多差一常数与度规张量的乘积，即著名的宇宙学常数Lambda 209 从12.7式就能理解Einstein 所说的，令Γµ νρ = 0，测地线方程退化 为： d2xλ dt2 = 0. (12.8) 方程的解是一条直线。\n\n弯曲时空的另一有趣事实是微分符号的变化。平直时空中的 导数利用下式定义： f′(a) = lim h→0 f(a + h) −f(a) h . (12.9) 上式用到了函数f 在两个不同点的值。弯曲时空的情形不像平直 时空那样简单。如图12.2，如果想比较球面上不同位置的两个向 量的差值，怎样才能得到它们真正的差而除去弯曲空间造成的影 响？微分几何告诉我们可以进行平移，将一个向量平移到另一个 向量的位置，从而可以9比较它们。\n\n9 实际上，微分几何中的坐标系 都是局域的。3.11节讲过，流形 的主要特征是局域平直（像Euclidean 空间）。因此，流形上 对象的坐标只在一个坐标域内有 效，同样只能在同一坐标域内比 较不同对象的坐标差值。\n\n弯曲空间中的导数称为协变导数(covariant derivative)10： Dbva ≡∂bva + Γa bcvc. (12.10) 因此，弯曲时空中的方程需要将普通导数替换为协变导数：\n\n∂b →Db = ∂b + Γa bc. (12.11) 这很眼熟。见7.18式，我们在先前的章节中讲过，自旋0 或自旋1 2 场拉格朗日量的局域U(1) 不变性要求与自旋1 的场有特定的耦 合。这一耦合可以用下式描述：\n\n∂µ →Dµ ≡∂µ + ieAµ. (12.12) 图12.2: 为了比较红色 箭头与黑色箭头，我们 将黑色箭头平移到红色 注意这不只是个数学技巧，它导出了正确的电磁学理论。弱相互 作用的情形也类似： 箭头的位置。\n\n10 这里的Christoffel 符号Γa bc 通常称为联络系数，因为它们联 系了进行比较的两点。\n\n∂µ →Dµ ≡∂µ + ig Wµ |{z} =W i µσi . (12.13) 强相互作用也是：\n\n∂µ →Dµ = ∂µ + ig′ Gµ |{z} =T CGC µ\n\n. (12.14) 尽管上面各式的形式相似，但引力无法像其他相互作用那样量子 化。其他相互作用都是用量子理论描述的，都给出概率性的实验 预言。而广义相对论是经典理论，因为广相中的粒子沿确定的轨 迹运动，没有概率性因素。\n\n210 Chapter 12. 引力 更糟糕的是目前没有任何实验能检测引力与其他力之间的相 互作用。基本粒子间的引力太小，无法测量。因此忽视了引力，只 考虑强、弱与电磁相互作用的标准模型就可以与实验符合得相当 好。大质量物体的广义相对论效应实验上可以测量，但量子效应 却十分微弱，因为大质量物体包含大量基本粒子，所有量子效应 被平均掉了。第10章导出了平均值的运动方程，它正是经典物理的 形式，毫无量子效应。 引力的量子化的困难可以列出长长的列表，不过Einstein 简 明地论述了引力与其他相互作用的差异：\n\n. . . 根据广义相对论，引力与其他相互作用（特别是电 磁力）相比地位特殊，因为描述引力场的十个方程2同 时确定了时空的度量性质。\n\n— Albert Einstein11 11Albert Einstein and Francis A. Davis. The Principle of Relativity. Dover Publications, reprint edition, 6 1952. ISBN 9780486600819 将普通导数替换为协变导数就能描述弯曲时空中的量子粒子， 但这并非引力的动力学理论。Einstein 场方程等号右侧（能动张 量）容易量子化，选定合适的生成元就行了。困难的是等号左边的 Einstein 张量，它用Christoffel 符号写为： Gαβ = (δγ αδζ β−1 2gαβgγζ)(∂εΓε γζ−∂ζΓε γε+Γε εσΓσ γζ−Γε ζσΓσ εγ). (12.15) 由此猜想Einstein 场方程或许是Γε ζσ 的场方程12，并且∂b →Db = ∂b + Γa bc 描述引力场Γε ζσ 与其他场的耦合。\n\n12 就像Maxwell 方程组与电磁 场的关系那样。\n\n无论将度规张量（两个指标）还是Christoffel 符号（三个指 标）视为引力场，描述它们都需要Poincaré 群的(1, 1) 以及更高 维的表示，或者说自旋2, 3, . . . 表示。目前大多数物理学家认为引 力场量子化后的引力子(graviton) 是自旋为2 的boson。\n\n目前为止，没有靠谱的量子引力理论13能比下一节列出教科书 上的标准引力理论给出进一步的信息。\n\n13 许多尝试过程产生了无穷多 个无穷大项，这对概率性预言来 说十分要命。\n\nFurther Reading Tips 阅读建议 引力的标准理论——Einstein 的广义相对论的更多信息可以 参考以下文献：\n\n• Ta-Pei Cheng - Relativity, Gravitation and Cosmology14是一本内容丰富、起点低的广义相对论入门教材，其 中有大量启发性的论述。是快速入门的首选。\n\n14Ta-Pei Cheng.

(B.4)\n\n• 一方面我们能用它来求某些函数的级数形式。这可以用来， 例如，说明eix = cos(x) + i sin(x)。 • 另一方面，也能用它来得到函数在某点附近的近似值。当出 于某些原因我们可以略去高阶项，不用考虑无穷多项时，这 公式的用处会很大。比如说我们要算函数f(x) 在y 的邻域 中一点y + ∆y 的值，可以写出4 4 不要被这些变量的名字搞混了。 上面的公式里我们是从a 出发计 算函数在x 处的值。而这里我们 是希望利用y 处的信息来得到f 在y + ∆y 处的性质。准确的关 系是：x = y + ∆y 和a = y。\n\nf(y+∆y) = f(y)+(y+∆y−y)f′(y)+· · · = f(y)+∆yf′(y)+. . . (B.5) 这就是说，通过在y 处函数的性质，我们能得到其在y + ∆y 处的 近似值。对于无穷小邻域2∆y = ϵ →0 的极端情况，函数的改变 量可以仅用Taylor 级数的一（线性）项来表示\n\n∆f = f(y+ϵ)−f(y) = f(y)+ϵf′(y)+· · ·−f(y) = ϵf′(y)+ . . . |{z} ≈0由于ϵ2≈0 (B.6) 这个式子是最有用的数学工具之一，它也能通过微积分基本 定理和分部积分推出来。基本定理说 Z x a dt f′(t) = f(x)−f(a) →f(x) = f(a)+ Z x a dt f′(t)。(B.7) 可以将第二项用分部积分写开：在f′(t) 前面补一个1 成1f′(t)， 利用(B.3)式取g′(t) = 1 的情况。分部积分能改写积分5R b a v′u = 2译注：原文有误，已更正。\n\nB.3 Taylor 级数 225 vu|b a − R b a vu′，积掉一项而对另一项微分。这里我们积g′(t) = 1 而 微分f′(t)，即式子里g′ = v′ 及f′ = u。求得 f(x) = f(a)+ Z x a dt f′(t) = f(a)+ g(t)f(t)|x a − Z b a dtg(t)f′′(t)。\n\n(B.8) 现在的问题是g(t) 是啥。我们目前只知道g′(t) = 1，但却有 无穷多个函数的导数都是这个：对于任意常数c，函数g = t + c 都满足g′(t) = 1。我们选取6g = t −x，即将积分上界的负值−x 6 方程对任意c 都成立，我们自 然可以随便选一个，但那样就推 不出我们想要的公式了。选取恰 当的c 是为了得到一个有用的关 于f(x) 的公式。否则f(x) 将会 同时出现在等式两侧。\n\n作为我们的常数c。从而上式的第二项就可以写作 g(t)f(t)|x a = (t −x)f(t)|x a = (x −x) | {z } =0 f(x)−(a−x)f(a) = (x−a)f(a) (B.9) 从而整个式子现在写作 f(x) = f(a) + (x −a)f′(a) + Z x a dt (x −t)f′′(t)。 (B.10) 对最后一项再次使用分部积分，现在是7 v′ = (x −t) 和u = f′′(t)： x 7 注意v =′ (x −t) 对t 的积分 会出一个符号：v = −(x−t)2+d 积分常数d 取作零。\n\n2(x −t)2 \u0013 a dt \u0012 −1\n\n→ Z x\n\n− Z x a dt (x −t) | {z } =v′ f′′(t) | {z } =u = −1 f′′′(t) | {z } =u′ f′′(t) | {z } =u 2(x −t)2\n\n| {z } =v\n\n| {z } =v a 边界项同样简单的是零 2(x −t)2f′′(t) x\n\n−1 a = −1 f′′(x) + 1 2(x −a)2f′′(a)。\n\n2 (x −x)2 | {z } =0 得到公式 2(x−a)2f′′(a)+ Z x f(x) = f(a)+(x−a)f′(a)+1 a dt 1 2(x−t)2f′′′(t)。\n\n(B.11) 可以继续将最后一项分部积分，但是我们应该能直接肉眼观察出 规律了。Taylor 级数可以利用求和号Σ 写成更紧凑的形式：\n\n∞ X f(n)(a)(x −a)n f(x) = n!\n\nn=0\n\n=f(0)(a)(x −a) 0! + f(1)(a)(x −a)1 1! + f(2)(a)(x −a)2 (B.12) 2!\n\n=f(3)(a)(x −a)3 3! + . . . ， 其中f(n) 代表f 的n 阶导数，例如f(2) = f′′，n! 代表n 的阶乘， 即n! = 1 · 2 · 3 . . . n。比如对n = 5 有5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 120， 2! = 2 · 1 = 2，以及定义0! = 1。级数是下一节的主题。\n\n226 Chapter B. 微积分 B.4 Series 级数 上一节中我们碰巧发现了含有无穷求和的一个重要等式。在 这一节里将介绍关于求和的一些小技巧和几个重要级数。\n\nB.4.1 Important Series 几个重要的级数 从上一节中我们学到了任意无穷可微的函数都可以写成级数 的形式3。让我们从最重要的例子开始：指数函数ex。它的泰勒展 开式可以直接写出：\n\n∞ X xn ex = n! ， (B.13) n=0 用到了指数函数的4 定义，导函数等于自身：(ex)′ = ex。将a = 0 带入Taylor 级数，利用e0 = 1，便得到指数函数的Taylor 级数 （(B.12)式）：\n\n∞ X\n\n∞ X e0(x −0)n xn ex = n! (B.14) n! = n=0 n=0 这个级数也可以作为ex 的定义式。\n\n另外两个无穷可微的重要函数是sin(x) 和cos(x)。利用(sin(x))′ = cos(x)，(cos(x))′ = −sin(x)，cos(0) = 1 以及sin(0) = 0，可以推 得它们的泰勒级数。\n\n∞ X sin(n)(0)(x −0)n sin(x) = n! 。\n\nn=0 由于sin(0) = 0，故全部偶数n 项都为零，由此可以将求和分开： 注意到\n\n∞ X\n\n∞ X\n\n∞ X n=0 n = n=0 (2n + 1) + n=0 (2n) (B.15) 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 . . . = 1 + 3 + 5 · · · + 2 + 4 + 6 + . . . 将sin(x) 的求和分裂开来\n\n∞ X\n\n∞ X sin(2n+1)(0)(x −0)2n+1 sin(2n)(0)(x −0)2n sin(x) = (2n + 1)!

(C.8) C.5 对角化 235 上式两侧作用的是同一向量⃗v，这意味着⃗v 经矩阵M 变换后只改 变原来的常数λ 倍。每一本征向量对应一个本征值。计算本征值 与本征向量的过程有点繁复，可以参考任何一本线性代数教材。\n\n本征向量重要性的一个例子是旋转变换，我们用旋转矩阵描 述旋转操作，用旋转矩阵的本征向量定义各旋转轴。\n\nC.5 Diagonalization 对角化 利用本征值与本征向量可以使矩阵对角化，这能简化计算，并 且有助于解释方程的物理意义。可以证明任意可对角化的矩阵M 3 一般情况，变换 M′ = N−1MN 意味着基的变换，M′ 能写为如下形式3： 是M 在新坐标系中的形式。因此 矩阵对角化的含义就是可以找到 一个坐标系使得矩阵M 在该坐 标系中的形式简单（对角矩阵）。\n\nM = N−1DN, (C.9) 其中矩阵N 由M 的本征向量组成，矩阵D 是以M 的本征值为 对角元的对角矩阵：\n\n\u0013 N = \u0010 ⃗v1,⃗v2 \u0011−1 \u0012λ1 0 0 λ2\n\n\u0013 \u0010 ⃗v1,⃗v2 \u0011 .\n\n\u0012M11 M12 M21 M22\n\n\u0013 = N−1 \u0012λ1 0 0 λ2 (C.10) D. Additional Mathematical Notions 其他数学概念 D.1 Fourier 变换 Fourier 变换的思想类似于把一个任意向量按照一组基底矢量 (⃗e1, ⃗e2, ⃗e3) 做展开1，在三维欧氏空间下最常见的基底选择为\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 0 0 1\n\n 0 1 0\n\n 1 0 0\n\n, ⃗e3 =\n\n (D.1)\n\n, ⃗e2 =\n\n⃗e1 = 任意三维矢量⃗v 可以按这组基底展开为\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 0 1 0\n\n 0 0 1\n\n 1 0 0\n\n v1 v2 v3\n\n= v1 ⃗e1+v2 ⃗e2+v3 ⃗e3 = v1\n\n+v2\n\n+v3\n\n(D.2)\n\n⃗v = 傅里叶变换的概念就是对函数做类似的展开2，对于周期函数来说 展开的基底是sin(kx) 和cos(kx)，也就是说任意周期函数都可以 写成如下形式3\n\n∞ X k=0 (ak cos(kx) + bk sin(kx)) (D.3) f(x) = 1关于后者的详细介绍参见附录A.1 2从更抽象的层面来说，函数是广义上的矢量，也就是说它们是一个矢量空间 中的元素。对于不同种类的函数它们所组成的矢量空间也是不同的。这种广义矢 量空间的定义和通常欧氏矢量空间的类似（后者就是我们常见的带小箭头⃗的位 置矢量构成的空间），比如说，你可以像加两个向量一样把两个函数加起来，并 可以对函数定义标量积。\n\n3在某些点上未必如此，具体取决于函数和边界条件。更详细的介绍可以参 见任意一本数学物理方法教材（鉴于大多数读者都是物理系而非数学系的学生） ——译者 238 Chapter D. 其他数学概念 其中ak 和bk 为常系数。\n\n任意（无需周期条件）函数可以按基底eikx 和e−ikx 展开，但 是这时候求和号被积分号代替4： f(x) = Z ∞ 0 dk(akeikx + bke−ikx) (D.4) 我们也可以把上式写成 f(x) = Z ∞\n\n−∞ dkfke−ikx (D.5) 展开系数fk 可以写成˜f(k)，其常被称为f(x) 的傅里叶变换。\n\nD.2 δ 分布函数 从某种角度上来说，δ 分布函数在积分中起的作用和Kroneckerδ 符号5在求和中起的作用类似。举个例子，考虑 3 X i=1 aibj = a1bj + a2bj + a3bj (D.6) 现在我们想把求和的第二项提取出来，我们可以利用Kroneckerδ 符号δ2i，这样得到 3 X i=1 δ2iaibj = δ21a1bj + δ22a2bj + δ23a3bj = a2bj (D.7) 写成更一般的式子即为 Z 3 i=3 δikaibj = akbj (D.8)\n\nδ 分布函数δ(x −y) 由下式定义： Z dxf(x)δ(x −y) = f(y) (D.9) 和Kronecherδ 符号非常类似，δ 分布函数从积分中提取出了一项 6，我们还可以通过相似性从式\n\n∂xi ∂xj = δij (D.10) 推出\n\n∂f(xi) ∂f(xj) = δ(xi −xj) (D.11) 通过相似性来导出此式当然不能算是一个证明，如果你愿意你也 可以通过严格的数学推导得到这个式子。关于δ 分布函数还有很 多内容可以讲，但就此书的目的而言你只需要知道它是干什么的 就足够了。事实上，这也是Dirac 最早引入这一函数的方式。\n\nk 中分立变量k 在 ∫ dk 中 变成了连续变量。\n\n4复习一下，积分实际上就是求和的极限过程，∑ 5Kroneckerδ 符号定义见附录B.5.5 6即x = y 的一项，例如， ∫ dxf(x)δ(x −2) = f(2)."}
